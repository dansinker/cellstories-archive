  <h2>this is a shitty list</h2>
  <p>literally nothing on this page will remain for long. this is just a down-and-dirty list of all the stories that have been scraped, plus a few nulls, and weird pieces of shit, just to keep things interesting. 
  <p>everything here will be replaced by a real archive view at some point.  carry on.
