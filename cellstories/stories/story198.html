<h2>Gunslinger</h2>
	<h3>Andrew Reilly</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>In the dark, wicked, fantastic realm of heavy metal there exists no mightier weapon than a distorted guitar, its volume set to ten and its tone set to "kill." Yet within that realm of six-string savagery, the solo spot reigns supreme even over the sound of pure death, the no-holds-barred, frets of fury face-melter recognized as every gunslinger's time for throwing down the gauntlet and announcing to the world "FEAR ME, for I have brought the wrath of Hell and I shall RUIN thee!" </p>

<p>And the great ones—Kirk Hammett of Metallica, Marty Friedman of Megadeth, any of the Satanic mercenaries ever employed by Ozzy Osbourne—they understand this. But when I was 24, and I thought I knew everything there was to know about how to play the guitar, my favorite band came along and showed me I didn't understand a damn thing at all. </p>

<p>You might remember a Chicago band called White Spyder; I know I do. I had all their albums including the ultra-limited Black Widow EP. I subscribed to Spyder Web, their email newsletter. I knew how to play every song of theirs on guitar and a few on piano that didn't even have piano parts. They could rock, they could swing, they could jam, they could be cool, they could be cooool; they could do anything—except make heads explode. </p>

<p>By that age I'd been in and out of a few bands—never anything too serious—but what I'd found was that time and experience had fashioned my instrument into nothing less than a weapon: I'd pick it up, plug in, and suddenly my fingers shot death rays, which was strange considering how much of what I listened to was not really heavy at all. Yes, there was a lot of metal and rock I loved and certainly told everyone I was into, but also a lot of Miles Davis I almost bragged about liking . . . and a lot of Madonna I didn't mention too freely. But in my mind, there was only one logical conclusion: when it was time for talk, it was time for U2; when it was time for action, it was time for Slayer. </p>

<p>But these short-lived bands had an upside, in that a lot of other musicians knew who I was, and these people all knew that I could play and that I could play well, and they would ask me to teach them the secrets I'd learned from the Dark Masters so they might glean some of my wicked brilliance . . . okay, actually people just came to me when they wanted to spice up their tired old playing, which was fine by me: it was like I had become the Cialis and lube of Chicago music. </p>

<p>So when I got an email from Claire Sullivan, lead singer of White Spyder, saying her band needed someone to teach her how to rock and ROLL and ROCK SOME MORE and BATHE in the BLOOD OF ANGELS, and yes, I would do it, I would do anything for that band. They were an army fighting a righteous war of rock, and I. Wanted. To. En. List. </p>

<p>"We're just growing tired of what we're doing," Claire explained. "We need to open new doors—to play awesome, but not like these million-notes-a-second goons who keep auditioning for my band, you know?" </p>

<p>And at first, it was so cool teaching the singer of my favorite band, but after three months her total lack of progress stripped away most of the novelty. She had good rhythm, but the techniques never clicked; it was like her hands said slow down while her brain said, "C'mon baby, don't you love me?" </p>

<p>"You know," I told her, "not every band needs the crazy guitar work. I mean, yours is already great without it." </p>

<p>"I still don't believe you listen to Spyder," she said. "You like all that metal stuff, why would you waste your time with us?" </p>

<p>"Because," I told her, "dundun-DUN-dun-dun is an undeniably awesome riff." </p>

<p>Claire smiled. "You really know our songs?" she asked. </p>

<p>I nodded. </p>

<p>"Well, look," she said, "since I'm obviously not learning anything here, and you know all our songs and can play like that, how'd you like to be our lead guitar player?" </p>

<p>Whoa.  </p>

<p>Did I want to join White Spyder? </p>

<p>Did I want to join White Spyder? To be tasked with bringing the THUNDER, of scorching the earth with my unholy metal chops? Did she really think she needed to ask oh my word this going to be INSANE I am the LEAD GUITARIST FOR WHITE SPYDER—RrrrOCK POWER TO THE SIX-HUNDRED SIXTY-SIXTH DEGREE!!! </p>

<p>"Yeah," I said, my body straining not to give away my mind's jubilation. "I guess." </p>

<p>"Great," she said. "But look, we caught you at a weird time: we've got practice Thursday and a show Friday. Usually we practice four times in gig weeks, but since you already know the songs we'll be fine." </p>

<p>"Uhhh, won't your bandmates want to hear me first?" I asked. </p>

<p>"Trust me," she said. "for as long as we've been looking, they'll be glad to see you, and if we sleepwalk our way through another show like we have these past few months, I swear to god I'm breaking up the band. Just bring some solos, okay?" </p>

<p>Some solos. Of course. This would be a most excellent challenge.  </p>

<p>You see, when it's time to write a proper solo, every guitar player is faced with a very difficult decision: is this about them, or is this about me? Do I want to show off the greatness of this song, or do I want to show off how I can do those squealing buuWHAAAAA noises? The way I saw it, everyone already knew White Spyder was a great band, but no one knew what kind of guitar player I was; if I was going to become a known musical entity, my playing had to be more awesome than the band I was playing it for; this called for something drastic. </p>

<p>White Spyder's rehearsal space, The Spyder's Nest, was in a converted packing plant on the West Side, the killing floor divided up into 20-by-20 spaces, the walls so thin you could play along with whoever was next door; every now and then, White Spyder's neighbors would knock twice on the walls, their mutually understood way of asking for a two-room jam of "Black Betty." </p>

<p>I took one look around the room and recognized the layout right away: Drummer Todd's kit in the middle, Bass Player Paul to his far left, Claire in front of him and Guitar Greg to his right. Just like the stage show—dude, I am in White Spyder! I reached out to shake Drummer Todd's hand; he didn't reach back. "I've heard about you, man," he said, his eyes barely meeting mine. "You better be good. Set up in that corner over there." </p>

<p>Bass Player Paul turned away and tuned up. Guitar Greg wouldn't even look at me. I could tell I wasn't wanted. To win them over—to really be in White Spyder—I was going to have to rain fire. </p>

<p>"Alright," Claire said, "let's try 'Ray Gun.' From the top, 1 and 2 and . . ."  </p>

<p>As the band hit that awesome groove I had heard so many times, I felt the earth begin to shake as my hands reached up the guitar neck into the darkest pockets of HELL, clutching the SOULS of the DAMNED and brandishing them as SWORDS spiking the HEADS of those that DARED QUESTION the awesome power of ME-TAAAAAAALLLLLL and suddenly Guitar Greg waved his arms wildly, signaling everyone to stop. </p>

<p>"That," he said, looking directly at me, "was the worst thing I've ever heard." </p>

<p>Bass Player Paul chimed in: "No, dude. That. Was. Awesome!" </p>

<p>"It was just a sketch," I said. "I can add more if you want, maybe some sweeps and a little dndndndndWAAAA right at the end." </p>

<p>"Shut up," Guitar Greg said coldly. "Just play the song like we would, okay?" </p>

<p>"Let's try something else," Claire said, clearly sensing the tension in the room. "We've got time to work parts out, this is just to get everyone acquainted. Andrew, do you have anything for "Broken Machine?"" </p>

<p>"That I do," I said. "Broken Machine" was maybe my favorite White Spyder song, one I'd been rocking out with for as long as I'd even known about this band. I could play this in my sleep. </p>

<p>They started in together, like explorers on some fantastic island, wandering about, soaking in the unspoiled beauty . . . but there, through the clearing, sits a mighty volcano, and these intruders have angered the gods of the island, and the gods demand BLOOD, and on their command I PAINT THE SKY the most sinister RED and BLACKEST of black, notes raining from my guitar like DAGGERS into the HEARTS of mere mortals! Their maps do them no good, for their way shall be marked by the TRAIL of DEAD, limbs and FACES littering the road to safety! They try to run but— </p>

<p>Drummer Todd crashed his cymbals in a fit of rage. "Dude," he screamed at me, "that was uncalled for—stop with this Metallica shit already!" </p>

<p>"Why is he here?" Guitar Greg asked Claire. "He's not any good, he's making us worse with this heavy metal garbage of his—" </p>

<p>"I'm right here," I said. "You can say that to me." </p>

<p>Guitar Greg turned to face me. "You're not any good," he said. "I don't want you in my band." </p>

<p>I started to speak, but Bass Player Paul went first: "He's opening up our sound! Think of every time we had to say, 'No, that's not possible.' Well, not anymore! We're complete, man!" </p>

<p>Drummer Todd stood up behind his kit. "That's a stupid idea," he said, "because we wouldn't play like that even if we could. We play music for us; he's playing jerkoff guitar for himself." </p>

<p>"Look," Claire said, "we have a show tomorrow and there's no time to rework the arrangements. We're going to knock them dead, okay?" Everyone nodded; no one spoke as we left the Spyder's Nest. </p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>Friday night, ten minutes to show time, and a packed house at the Empty Bottle. We could hear the opening band, Johnny Come Quickly, stinking its way through the last song in their set, "I Copied Off Your STD Test." The crowd grew restless, chanting "Spy-DER! Spy-DER! Spy-DER!" </p>

<p>I noticed Claire pacing the tiny backstage area. "You ready?" I asked her. Claire looked back and said nothing. "Well, I am," I said. "We're going to kill them." </p>

<p>The band—no, we hit the stage and kicked straight into "Oakland," probably the rockingest song in their—no, our catalog. In concert, this was where White Spyder always jammed out like all hell, and as we wove through the winding chords, I could feel the rhythm in my hands, the fills in my fingertips, and I could hear the hum of the crowd getting into it. Okay, I thought, time to show them all why I'm here. </p>

<p>And something funny happened: as I laid into the song, the notes just kept flying, the music almost playing itself, my bag of tricks suddenly overflowing like I had won some kind of guitar hero lottery. As we rocked on, the crowd noise grew louder . . . but when it ended, that growl of approval suddenly faded, and I could hear people talking: </p>

<p>"What the hell is this?" someone asked. </p>

<p>"I thought you said these guys were good," said another. </p>

<p>"Man," I heard someone say, "has that guy even heard this song before?" </p>

<p>The lights came up, and I could see why I could hear them so clearly: half the crowd had left, and the other half, the half I thought I had so enraptured? They weren't humming with excitement at the musical wonderment I was giving them; they were booing us off the stage. I looked over at Claire; she was crying. I turned to Guitar Greg just in time to see him throw his instrument to the ground and storm off into the crowd. Seven minutes. Shortest show in the band's six-year history. </p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>Claire called Saturday morning. 
<br>"Hey," she said. "You're fired." </p>

<p>Fired? FIRED? The devil in me snapped. "No way," I said. "You can't fire me. Remember how long we spent trying to get you to do those deeleedeeleedeee parts? Remember how you almost broke your wrist trying to ninalinaninalina, and now you're going to get RID of me just because—" </p>

<p>"Andrew," Claire said, "just stop. This isn't some cartoon; this is my band—my art. I've stuck up for you but last night was the worst night of my life. My band needs something, but it's just not you." </p>

<p>And the devil in me didn't have any witty comebacks, because even if I thought I was awesome, I knew she was right. "When can I come pick up my gear?" I asked. </p>

<p>"Today's fine," she said. "We'll be in the Nest at 1." </p>

<p>When I arrived that afternoon, I headed up to the door hoping to find a band in pieces, the four of them at each other's throats: Bass Player Paul making my last stand for me, Guitar Greg and Drummer Todd screaming at the top of their lungs and their whole existence murdering itself. </p>

<p>Instead, standing outside, I could hear something else entirely: that sound, the sound of White Spyder, of those four playing as one, just like all those records I had, just like all those shows I had been to, just like all those songs I would never play with them ever again. Claire with her cooler-than-cool rhythm parts; Guitar Greg adding just enough spice to make it scream; Bass Player Paul slip-sliding down the low end and Drummer Todd keeping it all moving. They were a unit in perfect harmony and I was just another awestruck neighbor tapping on the walls hoping for a chance at a duet. Those four, together—that was what great playing was all about; now, on the outside listening in, I understood that. 
<br>Finally. </p>
