<h2>The Action Figures Strike Back</h2>

		</p><p>The questions I get asked a lot about my Star Wars collection are, What’s my favorite piece? What’s my most valuable piece? And, What do I think my collection is worth?</p>

<p>I’ve been collecting everything Star Wars since I was seven in 1977, but it’s mainly the four-inch action figures and ships and stuff.</p>

<p>I could tell you how much I’ve spent on certain things in my collection. Most people just shake their heads, but I think everyone needs to be into something. For me it’s Star Wars. I’m single, my car and credit cards are paid off, and I usually only buy Star Wars stuff with cash. Some might even say I don’t know the value of a dollar, and they might not be wrong. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Example. The day Revenge of the Sith toys came out in 2005. When Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones came out I was laid up with surgeries and I couldn’t buy anything for weeks because I wasn’t working. But when Revenge of the Sith came out, I think I went a little nuts.</p>

<p>My best friend, Cindy, went with me. She’s not my girlfriend, even though I was in love with her for many years. She’s this cute, petite, blonde who collects Breyer model horses. We hit the stores in Racine first, because there’s a Toys R Us there. It was a bright sunshiny Saturday morning in April, a month before the movie came out. In true geek fashion I wore my Attack of the Clones T-shirt with Jango Fett, Darth Sidious, and Christopher Lee on it.</p>

<p>We grabbed a cart, passed the front desk, and my jaw dropped. There in the corner of the front end was the biggest display I had seen of Star Wars toys. The banners were all yellow and orange flames with Darth Vader’s mask in the center of it all. The end panel had dozens of rows of the four-inch action figures. The bottom shelves had new vehicles. The middle had school supplies, books, Wookiee bowcasters, blasters, lightsabers, banks, trading cards, puzzles and so much stuff I didn’t know where to start.</p>

<p>Action figures and vehicles.</p>

<p>I scanned the rows of Obi-Wans, Anakins, Yodas, Darth Vaders, R2-D2s, C-3Pos, Supreme Chancellor Palpatines, Padmes, Mace Windus, Bail Organas, Chewbaccas, Jedis, General Grievous’, royal guards, battle droids, and Clone Troopers, all the cards with Darth Vader’s head in flames as the back drop.</p>

<p>I went for the bigger boxes first and went for the biggest one – the ARC-170 fighter, the precursor to the X-wing. I put that box in first and then started piling in the other ships.</p>

<p> If you’ve ever seen Beavis and Butt-head, when Beavis turns into Cornholio and runs around crazy on a sugar high? That must’ve been me. Cindy took one step back, looking for some sort of escape route, and said slowly, “I’m just gonna see what they got for Lord of the Rings.” She backed up, turned, and disappeared.</p>

<p> When I got to the action figures I wasn’t paying too much attention. I just grabbed everything. I usually get two of each, one to open, you know. I’m pretty anal about the ones I don’t open – no dents or creases. And I wasn’t even looking at the price tags. Orgasmic.</p>

<p>The coolest thing there, though, I did see the price. It was a twelve-inch scale figure of Anakin Skywalker called the Ultimate Villain. It was a pretty good sized box with a clear front to see the figure, which was a pretty decent likeness of actor Hayden Christensen, and all the accessories to turn him into Darth Vader. Fifty bucks. I’d spent more money on stupider shit, so I grabbed one and thought about a second one to open. Three years ago I remember doing the same thing for the Ultimate Villain from Attack of the Clones, Jango Fett. I only bought one and regretted it. But fifty bucks? I passed.</p>

<p>So now my cart was heaping, action figures sliding off the top. Cindy came from around the back end of the store and her mouth just dropped. Thank God the store was slow.</p>

<p> I went up to the nearest checkout and began unloading. And unloading. Cindy went and got another cart to start filling up with the bags I was now having to deal with. And when it was all said and done I had spent nearly three hundred and fifty bucks in less than half an hour.</p>

<p>And we made three more stops that morning. At the Target store the cute checkout girl asked if I got the special Darth Vader.</p>

<p>“A special Darth Vader, ayy?” I asked.</p>

<p> She got on her little headset thingy and paged the toy department. Who was this hot tomato that spoke so all-knowingly about special Darth Vaders? I must marry this woman. But then she said they were sold out. I found out later it was a lava-red variant of Darth Vader, one of the few Revenge of the Sith toys I don’t have.</p>

<p> And here’s where my disease gets worse. At the Suncoast movie store my brother’s wife works at I found a Revenge of the Sith version of the Republic gunship vehicle. Sixty bucks. I already had one from Attack of the Clones. But this one was in a different box. I had to have it.</p>

<p>We took everything back to my house and dumped it all on my living room floor. There was just so much stuff I didn’t know where to start. Cindy had to go to work and I still had all the Kenosha stores to hit. Then I looked around my house, at all the stuff I already had on display. I lived in the basement of Cindy’s mom’s house, a one-bedroom apartment with my own bath and kitchen. And I looked at everything and thought, this is never gonna end, is it? I’d be buying Star Wars stuff forever, wouldn’t I?</p>

<p>See, my mom collects Danish decorative plates. My grandmother collects spoons. Neither too expensive. I can’t picture either of them going on buying sprees like I do. My family never really had money. We were always middle class but never went without. For Christmas my brother and I always got Star Wars toys. Between the two of us we have almost all of the vintage toys, some in pretty good shape. But now I could buy this stuff on my own. I’m not made of money. If some disaster strikes I’m fucked. I have very little savings. I don’t live week to week, thank God, but part of me really wishes I could have saved all my money, maybe bought a house or something.</p>

<p>The last store I hit that day was Wal-Mart. I hate Wal-Marts. They’re dirty, dark, and just overall hives of scum and villainy. But as a collector they are a necessary evil.</p>

<p>As I tiredly sifted through rows of figures and vehicles and stuff I’d already bought, a not-so-cute female clerk, because the cute ones work at Targets, asked me if I had been out to the tent. Tent? I told her no and she directed me to the big tent out by the Lawn and Garden stuff in the parking lot. How had I missed that?</p>

<p>Outside was this giant red and white-striped circus tent, flap open, life-sized standup of Darth Vader at the entrance. This could be very cool or very scary. I went inside cautiously and saw...well, I don’t know what I saw. I saw geekier versions of myself mainly. Bigger, uglier, fatter guys in cheap Jedi robes hawking video games, playing interactive video games, and generally embarrassing themselves. This was the level of geek – The Simpsons Comic-book-guy geek comes to mind – that I never wanted to attain. There were no fat Jedi. I did the Rocky Horror Picture Show for many years, so I know what it’s like to wanna be something you’re not for awhile. But these guys were a bit embarrassing.</p>

<p>That was it. I called it a day. I went home and separated the new things and proceeded to balance my checkbook. Half an hour later I figured I had spent almost eight hundred dollars. My grandparents, who scrimped and saved through World War II and Korea, would have a bird.</p>

<p>With all six films done, newly packaged versions of older toys come out, and I buy them all. I can’t help myself. I have four different versions of Darth Vader’s TIE Fighter, which is in only one movie! I have two other Millennium Falcons, in their boxes! Unopened!</p>

<p>And then last year I realized I would be doing this forever. The new Clone Wars cartoon TV series came out. On the day toys went on sale I thought I’d check it out. I figured there’d be some cool looking figures and a few ships. Maybe I’d pick up a few things.</p>

<p>It wasn’t the grand scale of Revenge of the Sith, but it was more than just Clone Wars stuff. There was a whole new line of figures based on the entire saga, some brand new figures, and lots of reissues. I had to go back and get a cart.</p>

<p>And that’s when I saw the new Millennium Falcon. A hundred and fifty bucks. Twice the size of the original, sound effects, a working ramp, and a Han and Chewbacca to go with it. I just bought one. Thank God for that economic stimulus check we all got.</p>

<p>I don’t know what I spent that day.</p>

<p>I own so much stuff I have to rent a storage unit to keep it all. I decorate my house according to movie, I change it over like the seasons or holidays. My first attempt was the Phantom Menace. Everything I owned from that movie I put on display. I figured it would be the only way to see everything I owned. I’ve done Return of the Jedi and The Empire Strikes Back. Now I’m set up from the original movie. I’ve got bookshelves, coffee tables, a TV stand, a China cabinet, hooks on the ceiling – all with Star Wars stuff on it. I set up scenes from the movies. I have nine or ten Luke Skywalkers and Princess Leias, and everyone else. Right now my hallway end table is the Death Star. My coffee table is Tatooine. My dining room table has all my vintage stuff from the first movie on it. You can’t turn around with knocking something over.</p>

<p>A few years ago my parents went through a messy financial situation and it hit my dad hard, giving him a health scare. I helped out a little but it was also at the height of my collecting. I was getting stuff off eBay every other week for a few months. And I felt bad about it, I really did. But they were beyond my help. They owed a lot of money to a lot of places. To ease my guilt I went to strip clubs. A lot. I even dated a stripper named Precious. Talk about another expensive habit.</p>

<p>When my folks split up this huge weight came off of my dad. With his life in new order he now calls me from antique malls to see if I have this Return of the Jedi soundtrack on record, or that Death Star Assault board game. This stuff makes me happy and he knows it. He encourages it. I’m not gonna go on this life is too short thing, but we all need something to keep us sane. After a rough day I can just lose myself in my home version of the galaxy far, far away. </p>
