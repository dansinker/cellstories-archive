<h2>The Regal</h2>
	<h3>JC Aevaliotis</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>I’m sitting in a corner of the bar watching three porn stars undress each other. One of them is trying to karaoke Britney Spears' "...Baby One More Time." This gets awkward a lot faster than you'd think it would. The woman with the mic is doing a terrible job, but she seems to think it’s because there are two women trying to take her clothes off. There’s a strange muffled sound as she tries to sing through the fabric of her shirt, then an exasperated sigh. </p>

<p>The women are difficult to tell apart. Blond. Unreasonably skinny. All three have the standard issue disproportional fake boobs. Each article of clothing they're taking off each other can more or less be described by one of the following adjectives:  low-rise, tube, skin-tight, mini, thong, halter, pink, and/or leopard print. You get the idea. All revealing. All ridiculous. </p>

<p>The people I'm sitting with find this hilarious, but I feel too self-conscious to really laugh much. I look around the faux-wood-paneled Los Angeles bar that hosts Porn Star Karaoke, trying not to appear like I'm looking around the bar.</p>

<p>The place is 80% full of porn stars, men and women. They act pretty much exactly how you'd expect them to act. Imagine a cramped room full of people used to being the sexiest, nakedest, most outrageous person in the room. Now add liquor and a microphone. </p>

<p>The rest of the crowd at the bar is mainly die-hard porn fans. The die-hards are also exactly what you'd expect them to be. They can be described by one or more of the following adjectives: male, over-weight, creepy, mustachioed, lonely.  </p>

<p>I’m sitting with my roommate’s friends, who are here to appreciate this ironically. And they’re in heaven. "I think this is the high point of that guy's life," someone at my table says, watching a die hard get an autograph from one of the porn stars. She's signing a DVD case with one hand and groping another porn star with the other. She looks almost bored. The die-hard is thrilled. My table laughs. </p>

<p>"I don’t know," I say, "it’s kinda sad to me." Everyone at the table just looks at me. “I mean, if this is a high point for that guy, what’s the rest of his life like?” They stare at me some more. It’s clear I’ve violated some unspoken taboo against earnestness.  </p>

<p>“You’re right,” someone says. “It IS sad. Do you want to go make friends with him? Give him something besides porn to live for?” The table erupts into laughter. I ignore the feeling of my face burning and join in. I spent a lot of my time in LA like this, in strange places with people I didn’t know engaging in vaguely competitive ironic banter. It disappoints me how readily I fall into this, but, to be fair, if there was ever anything to be appreciated ironically, it was Porn Star Karaoke.  </p>

<p>"What the HELL am I DOING here?" I thought.  </p>

<p>It was a Tuesday and my roommate and I both had the night off from our jobs as waiters. I'd lived in LA for a little over half a year. I was crushingly broke, waiting tables and kicking myself for not writing or auditioning more. I'd moved there a few years after college with roommate, convinced that being broke in LA with a friend was preferable to being broke and living at home in Georgia.  </p>

<p>"My friend invited us out to this bar tonight," my roommate had said. "Someplace in Burbank where porn stars sing karaoke on Tuesdays. Wanna go?" </p>

<p>Most days, the only people I spoke with were people I was selling something to or buying something from. I didn't really have the money for a night at the bar, but I was desperate for non-transactional human interaction. Porn Star Karaoke was the best I could do. "Sounds strange," I said to my roommate, "Let’s go." </p>

<p>"You gotta be kidding me," I say as we pull up to the bar. It’s a grey aluminum-sided building in the parking lot of a strip mall. The place's name is on a poorly lettered sign with an array of mostly burned-out flashing bulbs:  The Regal. </p>

<p>People wait in a line outside the door. "Jesus, there's a line?" someone asks. </p>

<p>"On Tuesdays there is," says the guy who'd brought us here. </p>

<p>We get into the line, which is entirely die-hard porn fans. There’s definitely a pecking order to this line. If you’re a porn star, or with a porn-star, you get in immediately. If you’re a woman or a group of women, you get in quickly. Everyone else, pretty much hipsters and die-hards, you have to wait. We have a few women in the group, so we’ll be OK, but it’ll take a while. The line moves incredibly slowly. After 45 minutes, we’re only halfway to the door, and it’s already10:30. </p>

<p>I’m starting to regret not spending this Tuesday night like the rest of my nights off:  drinking alone and reading a novel. Then, a late 80s Thunderbird with open T-Tops screeches into the parking lot. I catch a few strains of AC/DC at impressive volume before the driver kills the engine. Three middle-aged men with huge hair and really tight pants get out of the car. They weren’t hipsters or die-hards. What would the bouncer do? </p>

<p>They approach the head of the line. "How's it going? My name is Jimi Jameson, and my friend at Playboy said he'd put me on the list, here." </p>

<p>The bouncer is unimpressed. The die hards excitedly whisper to themselves. The bouncer tells Jimi he isn't on the list. </p>

<p>"Are you sure?” Jimi asked. “I spell it weird, it's J-I-M-I, like Jimi Hendrix," </p>

<p>"Nope, sorry, man, you're not on the list." </p>

<p>Jimi is getting upset. "Look," Jimi said, "Do you know who I am? I'm in a band called Survivor, and I should be on that list." </p>

<p>At the mention of the band, the die-hards go quietly nuts. Survivor, apparently, is huge among devoted fans of hard-core smut. </p>

<p>And even the most ironic of my group is a little excited about Survivor. They were known for one song. "Eye of the Tiger." It was the theme song from Rocky III. VHI named it was the 63rd best hard rock song of all time. When I was 4, my dad would put on the record, and we'd shadow box.  </p>

<p>But none of this mattered to the bouncer at The Regal. You’re either on the list or you’re waiting in line like everyone else. </p>

<p>With much grumbling and angry tossing of big, big hair, Jimi and two-fifths of the band Survivor walk to the back of the line to await their entry to Porn Star Karaoke. 
<br>We finally get in about 20 minutes later. It’s crowded, but we manage to find a table. </p>

<p>I go in search of a drink. Sidling up next to where a man and a woman are dry humping on the bar, I order a gin and tonic and try to pretend like there aren’t two half-naked porn stars going at it next to me.  </p>

<p>As I wait for my drink, I notice a woman who seems out of place. She looks normal. Very pretty, but normal. She’s petite and wears ordinary jeans and a green Pavement t-shirt. She has glasses and wears her brown hair short. Nothing about her is fake or ridiculous. I like her right away, but I don’t get my hopes up. I’m not seeing, much less sleeping, with anyone. It’s been 2 years, my dry spell taking on a sort of self-pitying grandeur. I’m sure it’s just wishful thinking, but she seems to smile at me as I pay for my drink and turn away. I’m careful not to let the dry-humpers spill it. </p>

<p>I slide into the booth as a porn star begins to sing "I Touch Myself.” It seems to be written for this very event. The room is a frenzy of porn stars singing about and/or actually touching themselves.  </p>

<p>The porn-stars are without any inhibition whatsoever, the die-hards are in heaven, and my friends are in hysterics. I’m hopelessly in my head, miles away from the porn-stars’ physical abandon and stuck somewhere between the die-hards’ earnestness and the hipsters’ irony. And if I’m honest, all the sex around me is fascinating. I feel weird about it, but it’s been two years. No dating. No sex. The sight of all that flesh, all that detached artificial eroticism reminds me of my longing and makes my isolation more acute.   </p>

<p>I don’t know where to look or how to act. I’m worried I’m not being ironic enough for my roommate’s friends, vicariously embarrassed for the die-hards' too-earnest ogling, and weirded out by how YOUNG all the porn stars look. I look down at the floor, unsure where to put my hands. </p>

<p>Two writhing naked women bump our table, sending my drink tumbling. "Jesus," I say, moving broken glass into a pile with my shoe.  </p>

<p>I go back to the bar, where the same man is dry-humping a different woman. "Back so soon?" someone says. I look up to see the girl in the Pavement t-shirt standing right next to me. </p>

<p>I have no idea what to say, so I opt for the truth. "Some naked women got really excited about the Divinyls and spilled my drink." </p>

<p>The woman in the Pavement t-shirt laughs, and I desperately try to appear less awkward than I feel. The bartender comes over, "Gin and tonic," I say, and I look at the girl in the Pavement shirt. Finding courage from somewhere, I ask, "what are you drinking?" </p>

<p>She looks at me for a second. "The same," she says. I nod. </p>

<p>"Two gin and tonics," I say to the bartender. </p>

<p>“I think it’s ‘gins and tonic,’” she says, smiling. </p>

<p>“That’s probably right,” I say, “you want me to call the bartender back?” </p>

<p>She shakes her head, laughing, and I try to remain calm. As the bartender returns with the gins and tonic, the dry-humping bar couple get really heated. The new woman rips off the man’s tank top, exposing a perfectly muscled and very tan chest. </p>

<p>The girl in the Pavement t-shirt raises her eyebrows. I hand her her drink, then say “I feel a bit overdressed.” </p>

<p>She nearly spits out her first sip laughing. “Nice,” she said, “nice.” </p>

<p>I want to keep talking, but someone calls her over. “Shit,” she says, “I gotta go over to my friend’s table for a bit, but find me later. Thanks for the drink.” She strolls away. </p>

<p>Basking in the glow of my minor success with Pavement girl, I relax a bit. I still feel awkward as hell, but I start to see what’s so funny. We hear “Let’s Get it On” three times and “Sexual Healing” twice. There are also some surprises. I’ll never be able to think of the song “Good Ship Lollipop” the same way again, and there is a truly decent version of Neil Diamond’s “Solitary Man.” The man who sings it is being fellated by two women, but he has amazing powers of concentration. </p>

<p>After a while, the novelty wears off, and it’s just like being in any other loud bar.  Mostly. Apart from noticing particularly bad or particularly good singers, we pretty much tune out the event. So when the first strains of Journey’s “Separate Ways” come on, it takes a moment to register. “Oh man,” someone at my table said, “someone is about to BUTCHER this Journey song.” </p>

<p>We all turn to see 60% of the band Survivor standing in front of the microphone. Jimi is the lead singer, and his band mates take up supporting positions behind him. “Holy SHIT,” my roommate says, “This is going to be AWESOME.” You probably know the song “Separate Ways,” even if you don’t recall it right now. The chorus goes “Someday, love will find you / break those chains that bind you..." </p>

<p>It’s a song meant to be sung in a stadium full of screaming fans, but seeing it karaoked by another, different 80s band in a shitty little bar in Burbank is strangely appropriate. </p>

<p>Jimi has the voice to pull it off, obviously, and he closes his eyes and grabs the mic with both hands. He could’ve been in Giants Stadium again. His band mates back with spirited air guitar and air drums, which sounds ridiculous now, but really worked then. </p>

<p>I don’t know when I stood up, or how I know the lyrics that I am screaming. I don’t care. I feel more liquid splashing on my shoes, and I turn around. My roommate, a big fan of 80s power ballads, is standing atop the rickety table holding a lighter above his head. For those 4 minutes and 27 seconds, all the spilled drinks and lonely awkwardness in the world don’t matter. The song concludes, and The Regal is all high fives and rapturous applause, temporarily united by the power of 80’s corporate rock.  </p>

<p>For the third time, I head to the bar. I keep my eye out as I approach, but don’t see Pavement girl. But there is STILL a couple furiously making out on the bar. I give them a wide berth. </p>

<p>It wasn’t wide enough, though. An article of clothing ripped furiously away ends up draped over my head. I’m getting ready to laugh and throw it back, but then I see what it is. A green Pavement t-shirt. </p>

<p>“Sorry, bra,” the shirtless behemoth says, “got a bit excited.” </p>

<p>“Yeah, I can see why.” </p>

<p>He grunts, then turns back to Pavement girl, her pale white arms barely reaching around his massive chest. I hold out her t-shirt, averting my eyes in a ridiculous attempt to preserve her modesty. </p>

<p>“Thanks,” she says, grinning at my sheepishness. “Still feeling overdressed?” </p>

<p>“You have no idea,” I say, then I turn away from the bar. </p>

<p>On stage, a skinny, naked girl who doesn’t even look 21 is trying to cover her breasts while singing Patsy Cline’s “Crazy” into the microphone.  </p>

<p>She is tone-deaf and appallingly earnest. “No, I was wrong,” one of my roommate’s friends says. “THIS is definitely the saddest thing we’ll see tonight.” And the table erupts in laughter. The shy naked girl looks over at our table, terrified, her voice faltering.  </p>

<p>It all became too much for me. Pavement girl and the behemoth. My table’s laughter at the shy, naked girl on stage. She looked how I felt. I really didn’t want to be there anymore. I stand up and tell everyone that I’m working a double tomorrow,  that I have to go home and get some sleep.  </p>

<p>“You OK?” my roommate asks. </p>

<p>“I’m great,” I lie, “Just tired. I think the Metro’s still running, so I’ll just walk to the train.” I don’t know what I want or need or hope to find. I just know that it’s not here.  </p>

<p>“It’s cool,” I tell my roommate. “I’ll see you at home.” </p>

<p>I leave, nodding to the bouncer standing alone with his clipboard. As I start the long walk to the train, I keep trying to think of a Pavement song to sing, but I can’t get Patsy Cline out of my head.</p>
