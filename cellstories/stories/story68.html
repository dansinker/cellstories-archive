<h2>Good Girl</h2>
	<h3>Molly Each</h3>

		</p><p>I am good. I am a really, really good person! And I’m not just good, I’m like, goody-two-shoes good, like Kelly Kapowski, Marcia Brady, Opie Taylor, Sandy from <i>Grease</i> good. I’ve always been! 1st grade: pigtails, saddle shoes, teacher’s assistant. 5th grade: plaid skirts, French braids, patrol captain. 8th grade: khaki pants, chambray shirts, student council secretary. High school: anything from the Gap, yearbook editor, multiple academic achievement awards, homecoming queen. I only tried smoking once, I didn’t drink until college, I never swear, I have never done any hard drugs, I don’t call in sick to work, and I write thank you notes for everything! Seriously, everything! </p>

<p>But sometimes, even the Marcia Bradys of the world mess up, because of course everyone does. Like, I used to help myself to that bulk Brach’s candy at Walgreens, I’ve uh… broken some plans, and um, told a lie or two. </p>

<p>Okay, I know my list of bad deeds may seem on the mild side, but I have this paralyzingly guilty conscience, and if I so much as forget a thank you note, I’m beating myself up about it for weeks later. And if that happens after a thank you note incident, you should have seen me after my biggest mistake. Which was more than just a mistake, it was bad. A true screw up. The kind that knocks you out of the running for the good girl hall of fame. The kind that is so seriously catastrophic that it shatters your perception of who you are and what you believe into hundreds of puzzle pieces that you have to scramble around to get back into place. That kind of mess up. </p>

<p>The beginning: Three months after my post-college move back home to Minnesota, I was hanging out in my Minneapolis apartment one night when I got a call. “Molls, it’s Youssef. We’re going to the Library to see a band play. Get ready and come out.” This wasn’t the actual Library but a dark, damp, super dirty, $3 for a pitcher of a mystery alcohol concoction that will completely EFF you UP college bar on the U of M campus. I was in. I put on a tasteful, classy outfit that didn’t expose too much skin or cleavage, hopped in my wood paneled minivan (a castoff from my parents, and a necessity in public transport poor Minneapolis) and headed across the river. After a few months back in my hometown I was loving life. And this night? It was one of those crazy reunion nights that we’ve all had. Everyone was in town that weekend, and everywhere I turned there was an old friend that I just screamed and hugged, politely of course. I saw Jeff -- a tall, skinny redhead who I’d known since we were both 12 -- standing with his super nice girlfriend Lisa at the bar and I went over to hug them.  </p>

<p>“Let me get you something!” Jeff shouted, music blaring loudly in the background. “What do you want?” </p>

<p>“Oh, you don’t have to get me anything!” I yelled back, not wanting him to inconvenience himself. But he ignored me. </p>

<p>“I know what you should drink!” He handed me a cold bottle. I looked at the front. Smirnoff Ice. “It’s so good!” He yelled. I took a sip. And a sip and a sip and a sip and oh my gosh. It tasted like a crisp, cold lemonade, and wowza, it was like the nectar of the Gods running down my throat. And the bottle was so neat and pretty – it was totally a good girl’s drink! The band played, and I finished one off. I got another and I sang along with the music, another and I hung out with my friends, another and it felt so amazing to be with all of these people that loved me and another and another and I drank and danced and drank and sang along and suddenly I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I went outside for air. 
<br>I was shakily leaning against the side of the building, enjoying the cool summer night when Jeff came outside. He smiled, leaned next to me and put his hand on my lower back. Backstory: The summer that we were 16 his girlfriend completely broke his heart and for two weeks after that we were total BFFs—think foosball in my basement and long talks over Dairy Queen Blizzards. Because good girls are always there for their friends. They got back together later that summer and our best friendmanship faded, but he’ll always mean a lot to me. You’ve all had a Jeff before – that buddy who you have known FOREVER, but nothing has ever happened because of timing or circumstance, but when you think of that person you just feel lucky to know them. </p>

<p>“Jeff!” I said, “What’s up?” At least I think I said that, but everything was kind of a blur. The words came out of my mouth slow and clunky, like a rolling flat tire. The U of M campus was spinning and I was seeing 6 Jeffs.</p>

<p>The conversation started out slowly. “I’m so glad you moved back,” he said.  </p>

<p>“Me too! I’m having the best time!” But suddenly he was saying how much I meant to him. But I couldn’t really be sure of this, because the 6 Jeffs sounded very mumbly. And how those two weeks were some of the best of his life. And how we would be perfect together. And how he felt more for me than for his actual girlfriend and now that I was back in Minnesota he only wanted to be with me. Well at least, it was something like that. Let’s be honest, people – there are parts of that night aren’t exactly crystal clear. </p>

<p>PS--I’ve never gotten one of these movie moment confessions of undying love before, or since. In my good girl way, I simply changed the subject. “So how’s your mom?” </p>

<p>“Molly, I want to be with you.”   </p>

<p>“Jeff, your girlfriend is INSIDE. She’s inside!”  I said, but he just moved his right hand into my curly hair, held the back of my head and pressed his lips to mine.  </p>

<p>And oh my god, I LIKED IT. I gave in and kissed back, and it was good, really good, thanks in part to the Smirnoff Ices I’m sure, but it was so much better than any other first kiss because I loved him and trusted him already and maybe I wanted to be with him too (although Smirnoff Ice is commonly known to create feelings of love and lust out of thin air). </p>

<p>I heard the door of the Library open, and familiar voices emerged into the night. The concert was over. His girlfriend would be out any minute and shit, why didn’t I THINK about this before I went up all kissing him back and liking it! This wasn’t me, I’d never been cheater or the cheat-eebefore! I pushed him off. “I gotta go.” I turned and like, stumbly jogged down University Street towards my wood-paneled mini-van. </p>

<p>I turned the keys and took off. UGH! I know! I see you all judging me, and it kills me! All I can say is that I wanted to get out of there so bad, that the idea that I shouldn’t be driving didn’t even come close to my mind. I was just freaked out--I had just kissed someone who had a girlfriend, AND I WANTED MORE! I was the other woman! That was so not good little Molly Each! I was panicky and desperate to get home and sleep off the entire night.  </p>

<p>You think that’s my bad thing, don’t you? An illicit kiss?  </p>

<p>I turned off into my neighborhood, and my eyes just got so heavy, so heavy and it felt so good just to blink… and… </p>

<p>My neck jerked forward, the crunch of metal waking me up. On a quiet residential street, I’d veered right and hit a parked car going about 40 miles per hour. </p>

<p>Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck, I said. I swore more in that fifteen seconds than in my entire life. I blurrily peered out my windshield and I thought I saw the back of the car’s left end smashed in, the taillight cracked and broken, the window shattered, and a mess of scraped metal pointing in all directions. </p>

<p>What would you have done? All I knew was that it was 2am on a Thursday, the street was dark and silent there was not a single soul outside and I was WASTED. So I threw that car into reverse and drove home, completely awake now, a grinding metal sound coming from under my car. I parked in my alley spot, stumbled into bed and went to sleep without washing my face or brushing my teeth, which I never, ever do under any circumstances. Personal hygiene is very important to me. </p>

<p>The next morning I woke up to my roommate knocking on my door.  “Molly, are you okay?” I lifted my head, my mouth dry and thick, my eyes crusted shut. “Yeah, I’m fine.” I said, head still on the pillow. “Good, cause I saw your car and—“ </p>

<p>HOLY SHIT. I shot up. Oh my god, did that really happen? I padded across the wood floors of our apartment, the sudden movement kicking some serious nausea into high gear. I opened the back door. The front right side of the van looked like the Incredible Hulk had punched it in; the metal and steel and wood paneling were uncomfortably contorted, the headlight hung on by a single wire, the passenger side door diagonally jutted out. I walked back to my bed, threw the covers over my head and lay there. </p>

<p>And that’s where I stayed for almost 24 hours. Seriously. It was a combination of self-loathing and a hangover of epic proportions, but I lay there so lifeless it was like I just had my heart shattered. I spent the day popping Advil, and playing all my depressing CDs, my stomach turning over and over and over with shock, disgust, fear, and Smirnoff Ice. I replayed what I remembered of the incident over and over again. In between trips to the toilet I imagined the car owner – probably a good person – walking out in the morning and seeing this, stumbling upon a destroyed car, and I literally threw up in my mouth a little bit. First the kiss, then drunk driving and a hit and run – oh my God, who WAS I? </p>

<p>My bed was right next to the window, and I laid under my covers with the smallest hole to peek out of, and I just stared out the window, certain that any minute I would hear sirens and see lights, and the cops would roll up through my alley and knock on my door. </p>

<p>“Ms. Each!” They’d scream. “You’re under arrest for drunk driving, leaving the scene of an accident, and for being a good girl gone bad!” I’d go to the slammer for a year or two and when I came out I’d have like, “hard knox” tattooed across my fingers, knife scars across my cheeks, a buzz cut and I would never smile again. </p>

<p>But no one ever came. After 24 hours in a pit of depression, I called my sister. I had gone from good to bad in .02 seconds, and it seemed so unreal I couldn’t even cry. I told her everything. </p>

<p>“Should I go and leave a note?” I asked her. I wasn’t sure what it would say. Something like, “Hi, I’m the dumbass that ruined your day. Maybe your life. Just wanted to say sorry.” Or “If you would like to ruin my day back, or maybe my life, I live at 3542 Emerson.”  </p>

<p> “Don’t leave a note, Molls.” She said after a long pause. “It won’t do any good at this point.”  
<br>“But what do I do?” </p>

<p>“I don’t know.  Nothing? Just learn from it and move on. And lay off the Smirnoff Ice.” she said. </p>

<p>But for the next few days my conscience completely tortured me. Every time I looked in the mirror, the image of a smiling freckly girl was gone, and I only saw my mug shot with a fluorescent pink light blaring, BAD over my head. But it wasn’t just the  pinkish glow cast across my freckles that rendered me unrecognizeable. When I saw my reflection, I didn’t even recognize myself. It was like the person I knew myself to be was gone, vanished, crushed up in the hit-and-run. But I didn’t know what to do. How do you fix such a complete and total failure? How could I put the pieces of myself back together? If people know me as being good, and suddenly I wasn’t, then who was I? How could I find my goody two shoes again when I’d left them so far behind?  </p>

<p>For the next few days I put on an award-winning good girl front. I was back to no swearing, please-and-thank yous, napkin on the lap, volunteering at a soup kitchen. I even called Jeff to apologize even though it wasn’t my fault! I had no idea how to make things right, if there was even a way.  A week after the incident, around midnight, with Behind the Music: The Bangles unable to stop the reeling in my mind, I put on my coat and went for a walk. I walked and walked with no destination and found myself in front of the Hennepin County police station. I put my hand on the cold metal handle, and hesitated. I wasn’t sure what I wanted, or what I was about to do, but all I knew was that somehow I had to get back to being good. I went in. </p>

<p>There was a lone police officer sitting at a desk in the lobby. She was tall with broad shoulders and she looked cross and grizzled. “Can I help you?” She said. </p>

<p>I took a deep breath. “Okay, hypothetically, let’s say that someone hit a car a few days ago and left the scene. Let’s say that they didn’t leave a note. Let’s say that they wanted to fix things. What should I – I mean, they – do?” My voice was shaking and I rubbed my palms nervously with my thumbs. </p>

<p>She peered at me closely. “Well, at this point, there’s not much use doing anything. The insurance companies are probably involved, the wheels are in motion. There’s nothing that you – or someone – could do at this point that would fix things.” </p>

<p>“Are you sure? Because –“ She reached across the desk and touched my still-moving palms. “It’s okay. Things happen. Forgive yourself and move on. You’re still a good person.” She nodded, and went right back to the pile of papers on her desk. </p>

<p>I thanked her and walked out of the station. And to be honest, I’m still not sure why she was so nice to me. Maybe she saw the angst in my eyes, or the tortured way I rubbed my hands. Or maybe my regret and remorse nearly suffocated her and she just wanted me to get the eff out of there. Regardless, that random show of compassion was what I needed. Why couldn’t I be as good to myself? If this total stranger could forgive me, why couldn’t I?  </p>

<p>I got home, threw my coat on my bed and went to wash my face. I looked in the mirror and the mug shot was fading. All I saw was a goody-two shoes, a Marcia Brady, the kind of girl who would turn herself in to the police when she’d gotten away with it. For the first time in a few days I took the kind of breath that fills your lungs. I felt good again. That is, until the next time I forget to write a thank-you note.</p>
