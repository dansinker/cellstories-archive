<h2>I &#x2665; Robots</h2>
	<h3>Sam Weller</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>Just what has become of our robots, anyway? Is it just me, or does the present-day tableau fall more than a few gigs shy of living up to the beautifully anthropomorphized visions set forth by so many of the great and imaginative writers of future’s past?</p>

<p>      Science fiction has long uncannily foretold the technologies of tomorrow—from Wells’ rocket ships, to Clarke’s communications satellites. Then there were Bradbury’s flat-panel wall televisions and Roddenberry’s “communicator” that looks, oh, more than a bit like a T-Mobile Razor.</p>

<p>      Robots have long figured prominently into the technological landscape of science fiction. For more than a century now, fantasists and science fiction scribes have been penning tales of tomorrow that envisioned human-like robots cohabitating in the everyday world. Many of these tales, of course (notably Isaac Asimov’s renowned robot series), posited techno-dystopias where machines rose up to kick our collective asses. But certainly a good many robo-pop visages—from Forbidden Planet, to A.I,, to the rock band Styx’s rock ópera de queso, Mr. Roboto—portrayed machines processing and grappling with the human condition. Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto. Yet I wonder, where are these robots today? How is it that so many visionary writers and creators who predicted the rise of the humanoid could have gotten it so completely wrong?</p>

<p>      Make no mistake, I’m not discounting the significance of robots in our it –has-to-get-done-yesterday culture. Robots serve as integral components in assembly-line factories; they assist in hospital operating rooms; flying “predator” robots even soar over war-ravaged territories as unmanned recon aircraft. In a nod to Ray Bradbury’s classic story of a mechanized house still functioning after a global nuclear annihilation (“There Will Come Soft Rains,” 1950) there’s even a robot vacuum that will steer around your home sucking up sorted crumbs, hairballs and nail clippings. The war of the future, undoubtedly, will be waged X-Box -style—over a TV monitor with some gamer-cum-soldier using a keyboard and a joystick to control a robot fighter thousands of miles away. Still, as electrifying as this all may be, where’s the android on the precipice of discovering humanity? Where’s Fritz Lang’s robot Maria? George Lucas’s C-3PO? Arthur C. Clarke’s HAL? Even the Tin-Man in The Wizard of Oz fit the paradigm: a mechanical man desperately seeking the ability to feel. Somewhere along the way, robots moved away from the humanoid image and ventured into the more practical, more utilitarian, decidedly less captivating realm of the automata.</p>

<p>      The evolution of the United States space program currently faces an analogous technological conundrum. Once upon a time we had these larger-than-life space cowboys willing to strap themselves onto 95-foot metallic Roman candles: Sheppard. Glenn. Grissom. Aldrin, Armstrong, and all the other goliaths of cosmic chutzpah. These guys with their crew-cuts and their swagger didn’t know what lay beyond the bonds of mother earth. But they went there anyway. Americans were rightly transfixed. The space program was thrilling.</p>

<p>      On May 26, 1961, as John Fitzgerald Kennedy upped the ante by challenging our country to footprint the lunar surface, NASA rose to the occasion and actually did it (unless, of course, you prescribe to the lunar conspiracy theory that the entire thing was produced in a television studio). But for the sake of argument, let’s assume they did it. They landed on the moon using computers the size of pick up trucks that had less memory than an i-pod shuffle. What heroism! What nads of steel! The space program was filled with hope and wonder and possibility. </p>

<p>      And then, after seven lunar missions (including the aborted “Houston we have a problem” flight of Apollo 13), America abandoned the moon. It has been 40 years since a human being stood on the lunar surface and looked back at us. As we all know, NASA moved away from the moon and, instead, committed to the space shuttle program. With all due respect to the many astronauts who have bravely served on the NASA orbiter, the shuttle lacks the thrill and awe of going to the moon. After more than 125 missions, the shuttle has, to be frank, turned into a space-fairing delivery truck, sans the brown UPS paint job. The space shuttle has become as utilitarian as the robot vacuum cleaner, impressive, yet not nearly as inspiring as the near-sentient android of science fiction. Here’s further proof: recently, the international space station—the orbiting, multi-national science lab—was experiencing plumbing problems. The station’s lone toilet was out of order. The space shuttle Discovery was called into action to deliver new parts to rectify the lavatory fiasco. The headline on cnn.com said it all:</p>

<p>Space Shuttle Blasts off with Toilet Fix</p>

<p>      A far cry from “The Eagle has Landed.”</p>

<p>      It seems to me that the current utilitarian state of the American space program parallels the world of robotics—undeniably useful, while a far cry from the stirring dream-visions of science fiction. From 1927’s Metropolois, to Robbie in the 1956 film, Forbidden Planet, the robot has been played a vital role in speculative fiction. </p>

<p>In my own childhood, growing up in the 1970s and 80s, the humanoid robot (admittedly, during this era, often just a campy excuse for comic relief) was a fixture of my pop-addled youth.</p>

<p>      So what happened? We are now the future, yet our robotic inventions lack the heart and soul so many writers predicted. Where is a “fully functional” Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation? What about Battle of the Planets’ 7 Zark 7? C-3PO and R2D2? Wouldn’t it be nice to have Twiki around just to occasionally annoy the hell out of us with his, “Biddybiddybiddy?” Even just to have the Robot from Lost in Space to tell us all, “Warning! Warning! Our robots are a bore!”</p>

<p>      And why, in the end, is any of this important? Let us we not forget the sage wisdom of one Dennis De Young, man of the quasi mullet-perm:</p>

<p>            I’m not a robot without emotions, I'm not what you see,</p>

<p>      I've come to help you with your problems so we can be free. </p>
