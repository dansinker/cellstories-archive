<h2>My Dancing Feet</h2>
	<h3>Nick Ward</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>One morning last fall as I stepped out of my apartment in Roscoe Village and began my two-block jaunt to work, I was greeted by the strangest sight.  About 30 feet in front of me, headed in my direction, was a small boy.  He was probably no more than 10 years old, wearing baggy jeans, an unzipped burnt orange overcoat and no hat, even though the air was cool and crisp.  I watched him bounce along the sidewalk by taking three steps, jumping in the air and spinning all the way around.  But he did it rhythmically so that it became Step Step Step Spin, Step Step Step Spin.  His movements were natural, graceful even, and he wasn’t wearing any headphones so this dance of his was to some rhythm in his head, the music in the air, using only the ground as his back beat.  I stood frozen outside my door, mesmerized by this kid.  He actually reminded me of myself at that age, carefree and boisterous.  As he got closer to me (Step Step Step Spin), he saw me watching him and started to smile, this wide and toothy grin that said he didn’t care how silly he looked, that he was proud of it.  He finally got right next to me, perfected a Spin, planted and shouted, “Hi!” </p>

<p>I watched him go <i>step step step spin</i> and felt warmed by his exuberance but also incredibly envious.  When was the last time I did that, I thought?  When was the last time I actually took the time to enjoy walking down the street?  When was the last time I danced, just because? </p>

<p>Now, typically, I’m the kinda guy who plants his feet at concerts, doing the hipster knee bob while nodding approvingly.  But from the first, my natural inclination has been to gravitate—sliding and gliding—towards soul music. </p>

<p>See I was raised in Detroit.  Okay, so I was actually raised in the suburbs of Detroit but you gotta understand that the pulsating beat of Motown extended far enough so that I practically came out of the womb screaming, “I know you wanna leave me!/ But I refuse to let you go!”  I cannot remember a time when soul music wasn’t a part of my life but I do remember the first time I danced in front of people.  I was nine years old, an awkward kid, small for my age with short, military hair and gigantic glasses.  It was at the wedding reception of a family friend, I don’t remember who, held at a generic country club somewhere in the Detroit suburbs, a huge tope-shaded banquet room with tall windows that overlooked a picturesque golf course.  That was also the first time I saw my parents dance. </p>

<p>I remember my mother leaned in close to my father.  “Oh dear,” she said, “I want to dance with you.”  They waded out onto the floor with the other couples to cut a rug.  Now, my parents—as much as I love them—are terrible dancers and I watched that night as my mom performed her patented middle-aged woman move of stepping from one side to the next, as she clapped her hands and repeated, while my father tried gamely and lamely to keep up.  And although I knew they couldn’t keep time with even the simplest beat, they looked so cool to me shaking and jiving on that dance floor.  A few years later, of course, my parents—like all parents—would become dumb and lame but when you’re nine years old, everything grown people do is cool, right? </p>

<p>And watching my parents dance, that’s when I heard “Billie Jean”.  The drums, sharp and forceful, followed by that rolling baseline.  I started to bob my head a little bit.  I had never heard anything so magical, so amazing, so. . . .cool in my entire life.  The light and airy synth kicked in and I was in heaven.  Even now, whenever I hear music like that, it’s all I can do not to jump up and dance, although usually, if I’m in line at the bank or something, I restrain myself.  Then, at the age of 9, I didn’t care.  I hopped out of my seat at the kids’ table, I shimmied through the crowd of banquet seating, hand-clapped past the buffet spread, shook my shoulders onto the dance floor, popped and locked past the DJ booth where I spun around quickly, lost my balance and slammed head first into a wall.  I fell backwards, crashing onto my back.  My left eyebrow opened up and blood began to spurt all over my little kid’s suit and the nice linoleum. </p>

<p>Immediately the party stopped and the whole reception turned and stared at me.  I started crying as my parents rushed over to me. </p>

<p>“GodBlessed!  Nick!” went my dad. </p>

<p>“Jack,” reprimanded my mom.  “Calm down.  People are watching.” </p>

<p>“I don’t care, Sue,” he responded.  “Who was watching him in the first place?” </p>

<p>“Honey,” my mom said.  “We can talk about this in the car.  Lift up your son.  We’re going to the hospital.” </p>

<p>In the backseat of my parents’ blue minivan, my mom dabbed a wad of paper towel at my eyebrow, the one on the left side of my face, the one that would eventually scar and become cleverly obscured by my eyebrow ring.  “That’s enough dancing for a while, don’t you think?” she said. 
<br>But guys, here’s the thing: it wasn’t enough dancing.  No bloody eyebrow could stop me.  And since I couldn’t do it in public—I mean there are rules—I took my dancing underground where no one could see it: alone in the living room, alone in front of my bathroom mirror, alone in my bedroom, always alone.  I loved dancing.  I loved getting sweaty and tired, gyrating and perfecting my moves.  I loved pretending that I was cool, a soul singer that made all the girls swoon. </p>

<p>But as much as I enjoyed dancing, it wasn’t until I was seventeen that I danced in front of anyone again.  I was a junior in high school, and it was the Homecoming Dance.  My date was Lauren Madison, a petite blond bombshell with enormous brown eyes and huge breasts.  I had had an overwhelming crush on her since the 7th grade. </p>

<p>Homecoming was pretty standard.  You’ve all been there, I think, in the school’s gymnasium with the risors pushed up against the wall, the blue streamers hanging poorly from the ceiling, the smell of sweat masked by the student’s over-application of perfume and cologne.  By the time Lauren and I got there, nearly all of our classmates were cutting their own moves in the center of the gym.  Something you need to know is that while all of the girls I’ve dated since Lauren Madison have made her seem small, insignificant and downright stupid, when I was 17 I thought making out her was the most important thing in the world.  And when you’re 17, you’ll do anything to get That Girl to like you, while being simultaneously afraid that everything you do will get That Girl to not like you.  So you’re constantly stuck, frozen to the ground, unable to move one way or the other.  At least, I was when we got to the dance that night and Lauren marched easily into the crowd. </p>

<p>“Come on,” she said, turning back to where my feet remained planted, five steps behind her.  “Let’s dance.” </p>

<p>“Uh. . .” and I could feel my mouth dry up, my knees go weak.  “No.” </p>

<p>“Why?” she asked slyly.  “Are you afraid?”  <i>Yes, yes,</i> I wanted to scream, <i>I’m terrified,</i> but before I could get any of the words out... That bass line. That rolling bass line, cool and sexy.  <i>Ah, screw it,</i> I thought, <i>maybe the key to our make-out session is the soul that runs through my body and into my feet.  It’s time to take my moves from the Underground to the Overground.</i> Small at first, I began to bob.  And then my shoulders got into it.  As the synth kicked in, I finger-snapped and spun around and then I could not be stopped. I hop-stepped wildly, kicking my legs in all directions. I wiggled and wormed.  I plucked a handful of fake dice from the air, shook ‘em and got rid of ‘em, releasing them into the wild.  I strutted around my date in a circle, cocking my head to one side and making the coolest face I knew how.  Boldly, I thrust my right leg sideways, holding it bent in mid air before shimmying to meet it.  It was my moment, and I performed all of the moves I had been perfecting in my bedroom for the past decade and pulled them off like I was the mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex and the dance floor my own private Jurassic Park.  I spun around one final time, clapped my hands and stuck the landing.  The song was over.  A single drop of sweat ran down the middle of my forehead and I smiled right at Lauren. </p>

<p>It was at that point that I realized two things:  </p>

<p>1) she hadn’t moved a muscle during my commanding show and  </p>

<p>2) the entire student body had stopped to watch me, surrounded me in a circle like a team of vultures ready to swoop.  Have you ever had 900 pairs of eyes unexpectedly thrust upon you, their expressions a mixture of shock and horror and mockery?  Have you?  It sucks.  And what would have made it all better, what would have taken all that pain away, was if Lauren Madison had walked over to me and planted one of those, end-of-the-movie, can’t-wait-to-get-you-alone kind of kisses on my lips.  Instead, she crossed her arms, shifted her hips to one side, and stared at the floor.  “You’re weird,” she whispered.  And then she turned around and walked away.  A chorus of “awwwws” emanated from the crowd, a million tiny pins pricking into my heart. </p>

<p>Standing at the El Stop that weekday morning last fall—right after I saw the step-step-step-spin kid—I thought about my high school Homecoming.  I thought about how much fun dancing used to be for me, and how no one is weird who just wants to have a good time. </p>

<p>And surrounding me on that platform was an entire city of people—an orchestra of businessmen and college students, parents and teachers, the working class and the upper crust.  Very slowly I started to bob my head.  And then tap my foot.  My shoulders got into it.  I pounded out a hand clap rhythm.  And when I kicked my leg sideways, I think I saw someone stare at me like I was crazy.  But I didn’t care.  I was dancing again, moving to the rhythm in my head, the music in the air, and using only the ground as my back beat.</p>
