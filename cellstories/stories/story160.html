<h2>Desert Women: Noor | Sunset Camp, Wadi Rum</h2>
	<h3>Rachel Monroe</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>Noor is forty-one, tan in February, with feet worn smooth and hard by seven months of walking on sand. She lives in a tent in the desert and cooks meals for tourists. For seven months now she has not taken a bath, or eaten a taco, or seen a flower that isn’t made of plastic. Her name isn’t really Noor, but she’s trying to forget that. It helps that no one at Sunset Camp knows her other name, not even Brahim, the man who’s trying to convince her to marry him. </p>

<p>A year ago she was in Minnesota, working the file room in the hospital’s ID clinic. A few things had gone wrong, money things, and soon she felt so poor then that she was unable to think about anything else. But sometimes now, lying on a straw mattress in her canvas tent, she thinks about how many things she used to own:  a coffee machine, small decorative pillows, a hair dryer, a bus pas, a Zen rock garden with a tiny rake to push the sand around to create soothing patterns, which she used to distract herself when the other stuff was at its worst.  </p>

<p>Yes and she had even had a house, though they’d been trying pretty hard to take that away from her; well, by now, they’d probably succeeded. There were mortgage issues. It had got so bad by the end that she had just stopped answering her phone because nearly every call was a trap. She would pick up expecting a friendly voice, or a voice at all, and instead it would be a computer threatening her with -- what? She never knew, because she’d always hang up before they got to the part with the consequences. But she could imagine. Soon enough they’d started using their better tricks, shuffling their area codes and putting real human voices on the line to try to coax her to talk. But by then she’d gotten the idea of leaving in her head, and nothing they could do could scare her. </p>

<p>It had been easy enough to leave her house behind. She hadn’t even loved the place. Sometimes, actually, quite the opposite -- the rotten boards on the back porch, the moldy grout in the upstairs bathroom, the basement smell that had infiltrated the whole house. Maybe it was something in the heating system, her mother had suggested, that made the place smell like that. "Like what?" Noor had snapped. She thought, somehow, that the smell might be noticeable only to her, because she spent so much time in the house. But no, the part of her that had still been thinking straight knew that she’d only gotten used to it; whenever she came back from getting groceries, the stink was much stronger, mineral and stale and damp all at once. So that had been when she stopped leaving the house.</p>

<p>Around February of that winter, all money had started to feel imaginary, like everyone —the boy who delivered the groceries she couldn’t afford and the exasperated callers from her mortgage company and her fretting mother  — was undergoing a collective hallucination, or maybe it was just a great joke they were all playing on each other. See these numbers? Let's pretend that they're real, that they matter. The most complicated joke in the world, and therefore the best one. The joke so good it had forgotten it was a joke. </p>

<p>Not that you’d call this period of her life “funny.” “It feels like people are coming in the middle of the night and doing surgery on me while I sleep,” she remembers telling her mother. “Taking parts of me out and doing a shitty job sewing me back up when they’re done.” This had made her mother cry, but how could that be helped? It was true. There hadn’t been any obvious scars, just a stomach-centered pain to wake up to and the ambient feeling of loss. The sense of some vital process not being taken care of. </p>

<p>She spent a lot of time on the internet, which is where she found them: the Bedouin camp 6000 miles away that provided volunteers with a tent and simple daily meals in exchange for “hard work, a positive attitude, and team spirit.” And immediately it had been obvious:  of course the desert was what she was looking for. What was it, after all, but nature's monument to emptiness? When she was younger, she had been an expert at running away; the problem was, she had also gotten too good at slinking back, apologizing, starting all over again. What she needed, she realized, was a place where she could deny herself everything, even grass, even birds. She would pare down what there was to think about until it was just water, sand, sky, a flat horizon and the search for something to eat. A place from which never to return. </p>

<p>Although when she got there, it didn’t turn out to be quite so desolate as she had hoped. The camp was a ring of black canvas tents for sleeping in, plus a cement-floored kitchen, a bathroom, a cistern for water, a place to tether the tourists’ camels. It was owned by a fat man who lived in town, and run by a handful of his lanky, Bedouin sons — he had 18, from his four wives. </p>

<p>But after even just a week, she hardly knew herself:  here she was, cooing over a camel's pretty, moony eyes; here she was, mopping the foul-smelling bathroom; here she was, digging the truck out of the sand bank Yussef had mired it in and laughing about it. At night the Bedouin boys built a fire in the pit in the center of the biggest tent, and while the old men smoked outside the young ones stuck batteries in the cassette player and danced around the fire. Noor sat in the corner with her sugary tea and thought:  it is impossible what my life once was, what it is now.  </p>

<p>But that was seven months ago, when the desert had still seemed like a place she might lose herself in. Now she knows better. Every day she follows her own footprints from the cooking tent to the dining tent, from her sleeping tent to the sunrise rock and back again. She would wear an actual rut in the ground, she thinks, if the sand didn’t fill in her tracks. </p>

<p>She’s been here so long and conducted herself so sensibly that they’ve made her the business manager. What that means is that three times a week she gets to hitch a ride into town to make phone calls. Town is 14 kilometers away, and there isn’t much to it — a sprawl of cinderblock houses, empty plots edged with barbed wire, camel shit everywhere, unappealing local candy, tourists wrapped up in scarves like Lawrence of Arabia. Still, it is at least another place.  </p>

<p>Sometimes she thinks that she might marry Brahim for just that reason — in its own way, marriage might be another place.  </p>

<p>She needs places, all the places she can get, because there is no way now for her to leave. She has no money, and she’s ruined things at home for herself. Her life here consists of:  the cat-piss smelling tent, the fine film of sand on her skin, sand everywhere, actually, embedded in the weave of her clothes so that everything she owns is tinted orange now, little piles of sand in the cuffs of her jeans, and slowly filling her shoes; small heaps in the sleeping bag every morning when she wakes up; sand in her hair; sand on her fingertips that she can’t wash away so that no matter what she touches, it feels like sand. </p>

<p>Brahim is kind enough to her, but tonight after an Australian tourist sneaks her rum, Noor will pick a fight with him over how messy the kitchen area is getting. She can’t marry Brahim and he knows it, because then she won’t be allowed to talk to other men and what would she do then, just sit in the tent even more than she already does? This is not what she will scream at him about, though. Instead, she’ll push the teapot over into the sand — this is very rude, and she will be instantly ashamed of herself, and sorry for whichever old man will now have to brew more, but once the action is started she won’t be able to help herself. She’ll walk out into the desert and when no one tries to stop her, she’ll just keep going. She’ll feel like she did when she secretly sold her mother’s computer and used the profit to buy the plane ticket to come here:  impressed but also a little terrified at her own ability to do things that aren’t easily undone.  </p>

<p>It will be night, and she won’t be able to see which direction she’s heading, though she’ll aim away from town. As she walks, she’ll think about how she’s found plenty of skeleton scraps in the desert before, goat skulls and camel shinbones and sinister chips that could’ve been from anything. There are campfire stories about tourists getting lost out here. What is it exactly that she hopes will happen? She’ll be walking slower now; it will have been a while. Her brain will spin out a story where adventurous tourists overnighting in the desert will rescue her, and help her out with enough money to get out of here, a job, a new name, a fresh credit history… or maybe what she wants is to walk toward her own campfire story, something with a sudden, brutal ending. </p>

<p>She’ll think it’s been a good three hours that she’s been walking due south when two lights in the distance will reveal themselves to be a 4x4 bearing down on her, and it’s Brahim and his brothers. Brahim will hop down from the truck and she must look frightened, because he will rest his palm on her shoulder and tell her not to worry, that he found her, that he’ll always find her, that there’s nothing to be afraid of in the desert, that it’s just like anywhere else.</p>
