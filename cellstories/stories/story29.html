<h2>A Country Fair</h2>
	<h3>Dave James</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>My Uncle Dave was what was known in the olden days as a "bit of a card", he was about 5 ½ feet high, pretty much skin and bone with pores blocked with plaster dust. He always wore a peaked hat, also caked in plaster. Uncle Dave was a master plasterer. His father, my grandfather, was a master carpenter. His peaked cap had sawdust in it. I was a master bater. At least that’s what they told me when we were in the pub, drinking the statutory gallon of beer a night. On such an occasion, by the blazing open fire, I was told the unofficial family history. I was told that my grandfather had the first motorcycle in Wales and was subsequently held responsible for a significant increase in illegitimate births in the surrounding countryside. One of my Uncle's claims to fame was that he knocked a highland bull out once at the county market when it knocked his pint over. I began to realize that this was a completely different side to my family than the ones I met so far, and the others were pretty strange to begin with.</p>

<p>I was spending my holidays in Wales in a town called Carmarthen where my family had lived for 15 generations. I was supposedly helping them in the various odd jobs they happily spent their lives doing. It seemed that schedules, plans, and budget existed elsewhere for these folk; if they wanted to work they did, otherwise we’d be off fishing or drinking. </p>

<p>We had taken the day off from fixing up an old church to go to the county fair at Carmarthen Rugby ground. Actually my auntie Mary was convinced we were halfway up the church's spire fixing the old beams, but that was one of my uncle's carefully constructed schemes to get a day off. He’d figured out that there was no way Auntie Mary could check it out. Besides, the aging vicar saw us go up, but didn’t see us slide down the bell ropes. He did, however, comment the next day that the bells had rung mysteriously--eyeing my uncle suspiciously.</p>

<p>So there we were at the fair, three generations of my family surrounded by really strange shit. They had boats called <i>coracles</i> shaped like half an egg, made out of tarpaper and willow branches. You sat in the middle, put the oar at the round end, and made figures of eight. Slowly, you went forward. I asked what was wrong with fiberglass and an outboard, to more laughter from all.</p>

<p>"Don’t worry about Dai, he’s Sais" said my Uncle smiling warmly and patting me on my head with his bull-knockout-punch hands.</p>

<p>"You see Dai, they couldn’t carry an outboard and boat on their back like they can a coracle can they, Bach? How would your uncle Gordon get away from the water bailiffs when he’s poaching salmon?"</p>

<p>Just in case you’re interested, <i>Dai</i> is welsh for Dave, <i>Sais</i> means English, and <i>Bach</i> is a very irritating term of endearment that still haunts me to this day. </p>

<p>It had been like this for the last two weeks: I’d try and pay for something only to have the money handed back and a favor asked, "Would your Uncle pop round to fix the drains?" or " Would you get your Gramp to pop around to..." It seemed to me that the barter system never left this place. I had drunk more beer, smoked more cigarettes and got more exercise than I ever could imagine back home in London. </p>

<p>Actually right at that moment I was drunk again, having popped into the Salutation Arms for an English breakfast and Guinness, I’m not kidding. They were wandering around looking at the various stalls of the fair, I was trying to stay upright, apologizing to everyone I bumped into and swallowing like mad, as I was convinced I was going to throw up.</p>

<p>After a while we ended up at the far end of the show and I shot away into the woods and dumped my guts like a drunken fountain cherub. Feeling a little better and mopping my face, I entered the rapidly formed arena of my friends, family and other folk who had been assembled by my Uncle. To a backdrop of applause, jeers, hoots and merriment, I staggered into the Welsh wildlife tent and collapsed. </p>

<p>Lying down contemplating the tent fabric billowing in the wind was very relaxing; from outside I could still hear the laughter and my Uncle replaying some of my more embarrassing moments to his audience. My whole world was spinning. I desperately dug my hands in to the soft grass and closed my eyes. And then, from the far reaches of the conscious world, came a voice:</p>

<p>"Are you all right Bach?" it said.</p>

<p>I opened my eyes a little and saw a female Boris Karloff wearing glasses. Jumping up, I shot forward and slid down the side of the tent.</p>

<p>"I think you’d better stay there for a bit, Bach. Would you like some lemonade?" she asked, offering me a large glass, which I took after three attempts.</p>

<p>The lemonade helped lot, it cleared all the diced carrots and bile from my mouth and I was rapidly becoming human again. The little old lady was talking again.</p>

<p>" …to sign our list?" she said waving an old clipboard in front of me.</p>

<p>"Eyemzorry?" I slurred, "neep?"</p>

<p>"Would you like to sign our list, Bach?" The kind little old lady repeated a little more slowly.</p>

<p>Taking the clipboard I tried to read the writing, but couldn’t focus. I was having difficulty figuring our how the clipboard worked. In my drunken stupor it had become a complex machine, which could only be manipulated by skilled personnel. </p>

<p>When my savior handed me a pen, life became trickier. I kept trying to sign the grass, the tent, and my forehead--everything except the damn page. Patiently, she guided my hand to the right bit and I managed to squirt ink over the paper. Thinking quickly, I pressed my thumb onto the blot and proudly handed the board back, grinning insanely at my ingenuity.</p>

<p>"Why thank you, Bach," the little old lady said. "I’ll get your Uncle now--see you in three weeks!"</p>

<p>I remember wondering what the hell she was babbling about just before nodding off again.</p>

<p>I was woken by a distinct bobbing feeling and wondered if I was having an out-of-body experience. Opening my eyes, I saw mainly blue with black edges. I could smell tar and wood, I could hear water lapping against the fabric of the tent. </p>

<p>Wait a second--water lapping against the tent?</p>

<p>Sitting upright I found out that my Uncle and Gramp had struck again. The fuckers had got together with my Uncle Gordon and set me adrift in the fucking coracle. They had, of course, removed the fucking oar. Up and down the riverbank was a thin line of waving, laughing bastards taking real pleasure in my latest humiliation. All of them were descended from the folk that watched Christians being snacked on by lions or French nobles blunting guillotines. At the very end of the line, in the prime spectator spot was good old Uncle Dave. </p>

<p>He had picked this spot because of the splendid view of the weir, my next challenge. It was a very big weir, with water speeding down a zillion-mile slope populated with Volkswagen-sized boulders. Uncle Dave was sitting down, enjoying a pint, and lighting up a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Hello Dai, how’s the head?" he yelled, grinning and getting a cheer from the crowd.</p>

<p>"Fuck you Uncle agghhhhhhhhh!"</p>

<p>My spirited reply was cut short as I began my little trip into hell. My drunken spin was now compensated by the spin of the coracle as the waters of death took hold. Boulders thumped me aside as I continued on down the slope. The water picked up speed, causing the children--running along the bank--to become more haphazard. One of them fell in. Good, I thought, welcome to my world you little shit. I grabbed the sides of the coracle and coughed. The cough had the effect of causing me to gag again, I was near the bank and Uncle was five feet away--could I make it? </p>

<p>The boat spun around again and, with one mighty spasm, I vomited the remaining half-eaten breakfast straight at him. A direct hit! Uncle was now a dancing advert for diced carrots, I was coming to the end of my nightmare trip, and the crowd was now pointing and laughing at my gagging Uncle.</p>

<p>The boat bumped against the bank and I got out, a little unsteady on my feet but still able to run. But before I could start I noticed that Gramp had pushed Uncle into the river and was bent over laughing so hard I thought he’d have a stroke. I took my shot, ran over and pushed Gramp in as well; unfortunately I was still a little unsteady so I followed them in. It wasn’t too deep and the cold sobered me up, we all stood up and pretend-wrestled each other to the bank. As we sat down on the grass, watching Uncle Gordon wade out to retrieve his prized coracle and take the time to swear at us, we drank some more beer.</p>

<p>"You shouldn’t have signed up with Mrs. Morgan, Dai" my Gramp stated wisely, waving enthusiastically at Uncle Gordon, who had just tripped on a rock and gone under the water for the second time.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about Gramp?" I asked, puzzled.</p>

<p>"When you were in the tent, you signed up for two weeks on Skolmer Island, didn’t you know that?" he asked grinning widely, beer foam coating his lips.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Morgan got Dai did she?" Uncle Dave joined in the fun and took another deep satisfying quaff.</p>

<p>"When? I fucking didn’t! Where’s Skolmer?" I was rapidly replaying the bits of the day. "You don’t mean that nice old lady, do you? She gave me lemonade and stuff--which is more than you bastards did."</p>

<p>"That’s the one Dai, Bach. She got you bang to rights."</p>

<p>Gramp and Uncle Dave were now beginning to chuckle more. I eyed them warily. They knew something I didn’t and it seemed to be bad. I was to get a really great definition of bad later that summer, but for now I was happy to sit drying out with my very strange Welsh family watching my Uncle Gordon go under for the fourth time.</p>

By 2002 he had caused so much damage to the IT industry that they felt it necessary to pay him enough to live out his life "pursuing other interests."  Those "other interests" are now: taunting people in suits, making Starbuck's personnel say "LARGE" not "grande," and wandering around Chicago's Loop, giggling.</p>
