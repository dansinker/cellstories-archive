<h2>The Dresden</h2>

		</p><p>This is a story that I am not supposed to tell.  Four years ago, on the last Saturday night of my college career, I made a pact with Will and Dago, my best friends, never to tell this story.  We didn’t want anyone to know what we had done, so we vowed never to speak of it.  But now, I have decided to break that pact. </p>

<p>I met Will and Dago the first day of school our freshmen year of college.  We sat on the stoop outside our dorm and smoked cigarettes.  Our parents had just left.  We were independent.  And it was a beautiful day in Oxford, Ohio. </p>

<p>“I’m looking forward to smoking cigarettes whenever I want,” said Will, who at the time sported cowboy boots and hair down past his shoulders. </p>

<p>“I’m looking forward to smoking weed whenever I want,” I replied.  I was a stoner and I put too much gel in my hair. </p>

<p>Dago, the short one with olive skin, chimed in: “I’m looking forward to having sex.”  Dago is Italian and his real name first name is Matt, but everybody calls him Dago.  Yes, I call my best friend by an ethnic slur.  But that’s how he introduces himself so it’s okay. </p>

<p>So.  Four years after that initial introduction, for the last Saturday night of our college careers, we decided to get more wasted than we had ever been in our college lives.  The location was Will and Dago’s front porch and the recipe was simple:</p>

<p>      Step 1.  Smoke a bowl.
<br>      Step 2.  Drink a 40 ounce of malt liquor
<br>      Step 3.  Smoke another bowl.
<br>      Step 4.  Go out drinking.
<br>      Step 5.  See what happens. </p>

<p>After the completion of Step 3 in our plan, we were riding high, easy going and laughing our asses off, listening to some full throttle rock’n’roll pumping out of this crappy stereo that sat in the corner of the porch.  That song by the Darkness was on.  “I Believe in a Thing Called Love”.  We adored that song, especially the part where the guy’s like, “I believe in a thing called looovvvvveeeeee/Ooooooh/Guitar!” and the solo blasts in and we always air-guitared like we were on some arena rock stage and it may have looked stupid but we didn’t care.  But that night, the last Saturday night of college, we got to the “Guitar!” and the stereo just died.  Like dead.  But not totally.  The music stopped, only it was replaced by an ominous buzz, a hissing moaning sparking death toll that sent all of us back a few paces.  It sounded like a little demon had crawled out of the stereo and into our brains, corrupting our souls.  And when you’re at Step 3 in your plan to get wasted, riding high and easy going, the very last thing you need is for that to happen. </p>

<p>“Ahhhh” screamed Will and picked it up, holding it away from his body, like he was gonna throw it in the street. </p>

<p>“Dude, don’t do that,” I said. </p>

<p>“Why not?  Do you see what this thing is doing?” </p>

<p>“Just wait,” and just then, an idea came to me, a brilliant and devious plan, something I had wanted to do for many years and it took Step 3 on the last Saturday night of college for me to realize it.  “Dudes. . .by the time this night is over. . .we’re gonna throw it through the window of the Dresden.” </p>

<p>The Dresden was a house two blocks north of Will and Dago’s front porch.  I don’t know if it was the same at your colleges, but many of the houses in Oxford featured a name and an accompanying sign, usually something that symbolized some sort of college experience.  They weren’t fraternities or sororities, and they weren’t home to any families.  They were close to campus and the bars, and they housed anywhere between four and fourteen college students.  Some of these joints were pretty cool.  I had friends who lived at “Stop Making Sense” which, in addition to being a reference to my favorite band, the Talking Heads, served as a chill, party-loving, late night locale with good people and good drugs.  Most of the houses, however, were lame.  There was “No Class”, there was “Deez Nuts”, and there was “The Dresden.” </p>

<p>The Dresden was a massive establishment.  It was set back off the road ten feet farther than the neighboring houses, with a wide lawn in front that eternally featured games of beer pong or cornhole (maybe you call it “bags” but we called it “cornhole”).  In back, these enormous bay windows looked out over a nicely wooded area, a reminder that our town was still a little bit rural.  Inside the Dresden lived twelve of the biggest dickheads you will ever meet.  And maybe my definition of the word “dickhead” is different than yours but if you went to college, especially in a small town, you know the kinda people I’m talkin’ about.   Obnoxious, misogynistic and dangerous, they were the kind of guys who would fuck your sister and your girlfriend in the same night and not even have the goddamn common courtesy to lie to you about it.  Guys like that drive me absolutely crazy.  Guys who will steal your lunch money or stuff a freshman in a locker or boast about that chick they banged last night.  Those were the kind of dickheads who lived at the Dresden. </p>

<p>I realized I hated that place my sophomore year of college.  I attended a party there one night with a friend, who was a female, and who I definitely had a crush on, but I was way too afraid to ever make a move.  Anyway, it was your typical college party—kegs, flip cup, bad rap music—and I tried to enjoy myself even as I watched my female friend nuzzle up to a tallish, blond-haired, blue-eyed Dresden dickhead.  And I didn’t do anything about it cuz I’m kind of a wuss.  But, later, when I saw her leave the party in tears, I walked over to Blondie and asked, very casually, “What happened with that girl, man?” </p>

<p>He smirked like he knew more than me and replied, “Hey, bro, she’s got to get the fuck out if she ain’t gonna bend ‘em and spread ‘em for me.” </p>

<p>I wish I could have harnessed all the anger and the rage I felt in that moment and channeled it into a devastating, Tony-award winning monologue.  I wish I could have looked Blondie dead in the eyes and said, “You.  You and your actions are unacceptable to me.  Because I stand for love and decency and tolerance and you and your house represent everything I stand against.  And from this time on, we are enemies, you and I.”  Now, a couple years later, I don’t think I’d have any problem saying that, taking a stand in that way, delivering that Tony-award winning monologue.  Then, I just turned around and walked away. So look: I love to party more than anybody and I like knockin’ boots as much as the next frat guy, but I am not a dickhead. </p>

<p>And that name, that stupid fucking name.  Not only was it a lame, outdated reference to the movie Swingers, but when I hear the word “Dresden” I think of the horrific World War II bombing of Dresden, Germany, and I can’t even actually believe that anyone with a brain of a heart would name their house “The Dresden” and think that it’s cool.  Fuck that place!</p>

<p>Anyway, after four years of living around people like that—four years sitting in dorm rooms and classrooms and libraries and bars and on porches and in houses and apartments surrounded by dickheads and idiots; four years of Will and Dago and I saying, “Those people are dickheads,” “We should totally do something,” “Yeah”—after four years of all that, we decided to finally take a stand.  Cuz if nobody else was gonna do it, we would. </p>

<p>Later that last Saturday night of college, we stood in the backyard of the Dresden, in the nicely wooded area, and stared at those enormous bay windows, pristine and clear with not a soul on the other side.  A party raged in the front of the house, but everything was calm and silent in the backyard.  Will and Dago each held a speaker, and I the main unit of that dying, hissing, moaning, demonic stereo.  And just in case I need to remind you, we were at Step 5 in our night of partying.  None of us thought this was a bad idea. </p>

<p> “You guys ready?” I asked. </p>

<p>“Yep.” they said. </p>

<p>“Alright.  One. . . .two. . . .three.”  And we heaved that stereo at the Dresden and it collided with bay windows and absolutely shattered them.  </p>

<p>“Run!” Will screamed.  We tore off across the street, Dago slipped and fell in the middle of the road, but Will and I didn’t stop, we got to the other side, slowed to a run-walk and ducked into a nearby house party.  We moved through the party swiftly and deliberately, past the guys playing pool and the girls shaking to Jay Z, through the beer-soaked kitchen, out the back door and into the night.  We walked two blocks behind peoples’ houses and then circled back around to Will and Dago’s porch. </p>

<p>“Where the fuck is Dago?” I yelled.  “Did he get caught?” </p>

<p>“Shut up,” Will said.  “He’ll be fine.” </p>

<p>Five agonizing minutes later, Dago showed up, panting and out of breath.  “I fell in the street and went the other way.  I can’t believe we just did that.” </p>

<p>Immediately, we were silenced by the sound of police sirens, faint and distant.  We sat on the porch and watched as four cop cars, lights blazing, descended on the Dresden. </p>

<p>Will raised his arms.  “Fuck. Yes.”  And before we went to sleep, we made the pact to never tell this story.  The next day we graduated from college. </p>

<p>Two days later, all three of us were sitting on the front porch again and our friends Caroline and Dave stopped by to say farewell. </p>

<p>“Did you hear about the Dresden?” they asked. </p>

<p>“No,” we said. </p>

<p>“Some people threw a stereo through their house.  Apparently, the guys at the Dresden found ‘em and beat the shit out of them.” </p>

<p>Somewhere out there, somebody got his ass kicked for something that I did.  For something that we did.  And while I feel truly and genuinely terrible that someone else took a beat down because of our actions, I don’t actually regret what we did to the Dresden.  And if I had the chance to do it all over again, I might not toss a busted stereo, but I would definitely destroy the Dresden one more time.  Except this time, I wouldn’t run.</p>
