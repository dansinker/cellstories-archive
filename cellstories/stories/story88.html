		</p><p>According to the influential and highly respected blog, Stuffwhitepeoplelike.com, multi-racial, multi-cultural couples are in, and so me and my girlfriend Jess, who’s black, ought to be hot right now. My girlfriend Jess: she really does have the thousand-wattage smile that brightens a bad day, she’s funny, kind, a brilliant writer, and always has intriguing things to say about art and film and books and race and culture. In fact, talking about race and culture is how we met. I saw her at a reading when she wrote about being overseas, in southwest England, when she was the only black woman for miles around. And I said to myself, I’ve got to meet this woman; she gets exactly where I’m coming from, even though I’m not exactly a black woman in England.  </p>

<p>All this makes it ironic that we’ve been fighting about race and culture. Take this past December. Jess and I had been dating for about a year and a half, and we had moved in together in the fall, but this was the first Christmas we had spent with our families. We went to Danville, Illinois, to spend the holiday with Jess’s grandmother and her extended family. Danville, if you haven’t been there, is this flat, small city, bracketed by a thin river and train tracks, with dozens of mom-and-pop stores. It’s the kind of town where smokestacks and pick-up trucks are the most common sights. There were sixteen of us invited to Christmas dinner, and Jess’s grandmother only has this little ranch house that’s just enough for her and her dog.   </p>

<p>My girlfriend’s extended family was eager to meet me, the first guy she’s ever brought home for the holidays. I had already met her parents, and while they were perfectly nice to me, I knew that I, as the man living in sin with their daughter, had some work cut out for me. I hoped to get in good with the extended family. One of her uncles give me the two-handed handshake, you know, the one that says “everything is cool, but I’m the uncle you gotta answer to.” One of her other uncles, a law enforcement agent for the State of Ohio, smiled while he sat me down for a short interrogation. And a cousin, who played linebacker for the Fighting Illini, hugged me, nearly crushing my ribs, before telling me that I’d better be taking care of Jess. </p>

<p>Now Jess’s grandmother was giddy over meeting me. Within an hour of meeting her, she offered to lend me her engagement ring. Jess had been afraid that her grandmother would say something ignorant, like asking me if I ate dogs. I would have cracked up if she had asked that. I would have said, “Dogs? No. It’s best to get ‘em when they’re still puppies.”  </p>

<p>My girlfriend would have killed me. Now, to put this in context, I should tell you that whenever I talk to my girlfriend about Chinese culture, I lie. She once asked me, “How come you never wear your shoes in the apartment?” and I told her, “It’s a Chinese thing.”  </p>

<p>She said to me once, “Honey, you are crazy for your pork chops, aren’t you?” And it’s true, I love my pork chops, pork loins, breakfast sausage, bacon, pulled pork, barbequed pork ribs, bacon-wrapped pork chops, bacon-wrapped bacon!—and I told her, “It’s a Chinese thing.” </p>

<p>When I was home alone one day, watching some girl-on-girl action on YouPorn.com, and she came home early and almost caught me, I had to slam shut my laptop. She asked if I was watching porn, and I told her, “For God’s sakes, woman, it’s a Chinese thing!” </p>

<p>Jess used to think it was funny, but it got less funny when she met my parents, and suddenly being able to distinguish my bullshit from the real thing was the difference between her getting along with my folks and totally insulting them by accident. Jess had been on me with questions: “What’s the difference between Chinese and Taiwanese?” “How does feng-shui work?” “Chinese people don’t really eat dogs, do they?”  </p>

<p>It drives me crazy, because the thing is, for all my talk about “it’s a Chinese thing”, I know crap. Just because my skin is Chinese, doesn’t mean I know all about it. Sure I grew up in a Chinese family, but until I was 26, I didn’t have any Chinese friends. I had a few black friends, some Jewish friends, a guy I knew from India, and a Native American roommate, but I didn’t have any more cross-cultural experiences than your average white person. For so much of my life, I went around trying to pass for white, because even though I’m Chinese, I sound totally white. Even with my Chinese name, I went by Chip when I bussed tables at Damon’s as a teenager, and I’ve gone by my initials CP for so long that I don’t answer to my Chinese name. Yeah, I can pass for white, in polite circles, and then I’m jarringly reminded, “Nah, fella, you ain’t white.” </p>

<p>But there is a thing that being Chinese means to me. A few years ago, I started shooting pool at a bar in Lincoln Park, one of those places where you put your name on a chalkboard to get next on a pool table, and if you win, you keep the table until you get knocked off. These three other Chinese guys were always there, and this is one of those Lincoln Park bars where the only people of color there worked in the back. So one day I walked over to these three other guys, looked at them, looked at all the other white people, and said, “Dudes, we gotta be over quota here. One of us Chinamen is gonna have to leave.”  </p>

<p>They cracked up. After that we became friends. We started going to bars and restaurants together, and heading down to Chinatown for Chinese food, and I’m like, holy shit, I can actually go to Chinatown with other people without feeling like I’m a tour guide on a field trip, showing the tourists all the exotic sights.  </p>

<p>Hanging out with these guys defined being Chinese to me. My grandfather would roll over in his grave to hear me say, “Screw the five thousand years of history, being Chinese means I’ve got friends that I can call chinks.” But yeah, it meant that I had a group of friends, my tribe, that I belonged to. For all the things we learn from different people, it’s also really comfortable to hang out with people who are like you, other artists and writers, or other gay men, or other people from the South, other folks in the service industry, other people like you. Not because you dislike people who are different, but you don’t have to explain as much or be on your guard. You’re comfortable in your own skin, literally. These guys I met shared the same problems and laughed at the same jokes. They were my tribe. </p>

<p>And for all that Jess wants to know about Chinese culture, I tell her, “I got nothing.” And it drives her crazy because she worries that she’ll never really belong to my family.  </p>

<p>So, back to Christmas dinner at the grandmother’s. </p>

<p>On the menu was turkey, greens with pork, mac and cheese (with bacon bits in it), and ten pounds of chitlins. Chitlins are pig intestines if you didn’t know. I told Jess’s grandmother that the Chinese have a similar dish, but I never had real chitlins. When they’re cooking, they smell pungent, but they taste good. Jess says they smell like ass. She doesn’t eat chitlins. She doesn’t eat pork, or beef, or turkey, or any meat at all.  </p>

<p>Yes, at this feast of meat that her family was preparing, Jess was the one vegetarian in the whole extended family. On our way to dinner, we had to stop by Whole Foods to pick up a tofurkey meal just so she’d have something to eat. (Tofurkey, if you didn’t know, is turkey, except it’s made from tofu. It’s not bad…it just needs more bacon on it.) Though her parents know that Jess is a vegetarian, really they haven’t gotten used to the idea of their daughter, whom they raised on R&B music and barbeque, growing up to be a vegetarian, who practices yoga, and prefers the Dave Matthews Band over Kanye West. </p>

<p>As the meal was just about ready—it was going to be buffet style on the kitchen counter—Jess and her mother were in the kitchen. Jess’s mom wore her hair in tight braids for the occasion and had on a Christmas sweater set. Jess wanted to make sure her tofurkey wouldn’t disappear, so she whispered to her mom, “Don’t draw any attention to my food…but could you make sure that no one eats any of it.” </p>

<p>And Jess’ mom responded by bellowing out to everyone, “Okay, don’t anybody touch any of Jess’s weirdo food!” Jess stomped out of the kitchen, and when I caught up to her, she growled at me, “It’s always like this!” She glared through the wall towards her mom and muttered, “Just deal with it already!” </p>

<p>Then it turned out that her grandmother’s house didn’t have quite enough chairs for everyone, and after Jess’s dad asked us gently if we could wait a while, we stood around in the kitchen, watching the uncles and aunts cousins and her grandmother and her parents have Christmas dinner, until some of her cousins finished their meals and let us have their chairs. The two of us had dinner by ourselves at a small kitchen table, without the rest of the family.  </p>

<p>After dinner, I was in the living room with Jess and a few of the uncles and cousins. Uncle Derek was quizzing Jess’s cousin Brian, about living on the Southside of Chicago. Brian said, “Come on up for a visit. When you get downstairs from me, call and I’ll come get you.” </p>

<p>Derek asked, “Call you? Why? Do I need to be scared?” Brian shrugged, and Derek leaned in for the joke, “What, are there black people where you live?” He imitated being on the phone, “Brian, come get me. I see black people on the street!” Everyone in the room cracked up. Well, I just kind of smiled. I was seated on the arm of the couch that Jess was at, and so it was easy for me to slip off to the kitchen to see if anyone needed help cleaning up. It was like another reminder: “No, motherfucker, you ain’t black either.” How am I supposed to pass for black? 
<br>Jess and I left for home the next day. The highway was still slushy from the snowstorm that had hit just before the holiday, and we saw dozens of cars and trucks that had been abandoned by the side of the road.  </p>

<p>In the car, when Jess asked me, just to make conversation, what Chinese weddings were like, I lost my shit. I couldn’t keep on lying or joking around or making up stories. “I DON’T KNOW,” I shouted at her. “I don’t know about Chinese weddings, I don’t know about shit.” </p>

<p>Jess was driving, and her voice was low as she asked, “What’d I say?” </p>

<p>I sighed and stared out the window. “I dunno. Sometimes I think that maybe your NEXT boyfriend will be the right one. That he’ll be black and Christian and successful, a man who knows where he came from.”  </p>

<p>She bit her lip hard and refused to look at me.  “I don’t want a next boyfriend.” </p>

<p>We were on I-57, halfway between Champaign-Urbana and Chicago. It’s like any interstate where you see McDonald’s and Burger Kings and Wendy’s and the lowest common denominator for what it means to be an American. For all we do to try to bridge the gap between races and cultures, ultimately, maybe the only thing everyone has in common is french fries.  </p>

<p>We drove in silence. I thought about how the people who do internet dating had the right idea. Put all your baggage online and let the computers sort it out. Why date someone you meet in the bar, and maybe fall in love, only to find out that you can’t get over your differences.  </p>

<p>When Jess and I got back to Chicago, we unpacked our things and collapsed into bed. Our bedroom walls are covered with art work, paintings and sketches that either we or our friends made . I stared at the ceiling in the dark; I could tell she hadn’t fallen asleep by her breathing. I broke the silence, and I told her, “I know you don’t wish I were black, but I just feel like an outsider with your family.”  </p>

<p>She turned, shifting so that her outside leg wrapped over my thighs and she hugged me. Her face nestled into my neck as she murmured, “If you’re on the outside, then that’s where I want to be, too. Hell, I’m the black sheep in my own family.”  </p>

<p>She rolled over on to her back and sighed. I knew she was thinking about her mother.   </p>

<p>In the dark of our bedroom, I asked her, “What does a black sheep sound like?” </p>

<p>She thought about it for a second, and then she said, “Baaaa…nigga!” </p>

<p>We laughed, and afterwards she said, “Maybe we can make our own tribe.” </p>

<p>“Yeah, I’d like that.” With that, we fell asleep, holding hands throughout the night.</p>
