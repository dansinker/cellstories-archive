<h2>An Eviction</h2>
	<h3>Joshua Lukasik</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>  Three Will County Sheriff squad cars drove down Cove Street in New Lenox, Illinois. Rain pelted their windshields and the wind swayed the power lines that hung from tower-to-tower out across the open field that ran parallel to the road.</p>

<p>      Ted sat in his truck facing the open fields. He parked on Cove Street, staring at the rain falling onto the asphalt. Behind his truck was a Silverado filled with six men, he saw their darkened heads in his rear view mirror. Out his passenger window was Cove Street. A two story house with two car garage, a front porch with flower boxes perched off the wooden railings, and with a wooden bench near the front door that had: “The Grants” engraved along the back rest.</p>

<p>      A scarecrow was staked into the ground by the bay window that had the blinds shut. Around the scarecrow were boxwoods and arborvitaes that grew in lee of a tall Evergreen that peaked evenly with the brick chimney at the corner of the roof.</p>

<p>      The squad cars pulled up along the curb; the lead car’s side mirror barely grazing the mailbox. Their caution lights turned on and blinked in succession. When all six sheriffs stepped out, strapped up with body armor, each one removed their black caps. As was accustomed with evictions, this time, they did not pull the torpedo-shaped battering ram out of the trunk, nor did they wield the maul hammer—a hammer that resembled an axe but was made out of pure stainless steel.</p>

<p>      When they knocked on the door, they didn’t stand in 2x2x2 formation, nor did they have their hands on the butts of their guns. They stood in a horseshoe, their hands folded and resting at the bottom rim of their body armor. Ted and the six maintenance guys stood in a cluster in the front yard, and for the first time in awhile, a little nervous about an eviction. They had no idea how Michael Grant would react.</p>

<p>      For two years this eviction had been in process, “He used to call me up and say if he got evicted his wife would leave him, or, he would tell me he’d kill himself,” Ted Rathner said. Ted was a small business owner, his company profited around nine-hundred thousand dollars a year which paid for sixteen salaries, two company cars, and an office in Lockport, Illinois. Looking at Ted, you might think he was a young punk: tattooed down the length of his left arm, piercings below his bottom lip, his right eyebrow, an industrial bar along the top of his ear, and another piercing on the lobe. He broke all of his fingers twice and he could not feel the tip of the thumb that got smashed between a trailer and a truck’s ball hitch. He said, “We’ve offered him ten thousand dollars to twelve thousand dollars to leave, but he just won’t.”</p>

<p>      Nicholas Polk, who wasn’t at the eviction but had inspected his house for the two years said, “He use to come outside and wave at me with a smile. Like nothing’s going on, while I took pictures. But the first time I met him, he chased me in his yellow Rav4, the only reason I stopped was he had his arm outside the window, waving a police badge.”</p>

<p>      Life didn’t stop at Cove Street during those years. Yard decorations evolved with the holidays, a fern with a red ribbon hung on the front door during Christmas, a cluster of mums grew in a turkey vase during Thanksgiving, graduation parties were hosted, even a wooden stork stood in the yard with a bundle between his beak, and exclaiming, ‘It’s a boy!’.</p>

<p>      The cars and trucks in the driveway didn’t change, Michael Grant’s yellow Rav4, his son’s lifted Dodge Ram, his daughter’s Pontiac Grand Prix, his wife always worked late. Throughout the two years, life for The Grant’s steeped in normalcy; a mood perpetrated by Michael who fought off five evictions, three cash-for-keys, and who only had to face the stark and grim reality when Nicholas snapped photos once a week. He told his family Nick was an insurance adjuster. Throughout all those years he stepped confidently out the front door of his home, without a sense of worry traced in the lineaments of his face.</p>

<p>      But when Michael Grant answered the second knock that morning on October 12, 2009, tears were already dripping off the curve of his cheek. He was in a blue robe that flapped in the wind, he had on Harley-Davidson boxers and an undershirt.</p>

<p>      “Come on Mike, it’s time to go,” the biggest cop said, a bald man who’s name was Fred.</p>

<p>      “What are you guys here for?” Michael said.</p>

<p>      “Mikey, we called you last night, telling you when we would be here.” Fred whispered, “Come on, did you pack?”</p>

<p>      His eyes scrunched, tears appeared between the folds of his skin. With his hand he grabbed his bangs and squealed. A woman officer trotted back to her car covering her hands to her face. Michael ran back into the house and the other officers followed. The maintenance guys grabbed garbage bags and headed inside.</p>

<p>      “Over five years in this business I’ve never seen what I saw in that house,” Ted said. They found nothing moved. They didn’t rip pipes out of the walls. They didn’t sell all their possessions for cash. They didn’t trash the place out of frustration, it was clean, normal. It reminded everyone of their own home.</p>

<p>      “For the first time, it felt like we were actually moving someone out into the street,” a maintenance guy said.</p>

<p>      The house contained impressive things like a three piece suede furniture set in the living room, a twelve piece leather couch in the family room, thirty plates made of fine china, an oak coffee table, porcelain lamps, a solid oak liquor cabinet with a wine rack, a seventy-seven inch plasma flat screen television, stainless steel refrigerator, and a matching stove.</p>

<p>      Fifteen years worth of shopping, heavy price items that you saved money for, took loans out for, and then, even possessions that carried more weight in your soul then it did in your hands. Everything smaller went in garbage bags, over fifteen forty-two gallon bags made up of just food, even more personal, his daughter’s Aerosmith CD collection, his son’s soccer trophies, diamond earrings and silver bracelets in his wife’s jewelry box, all went tumbling into the bags.</p>

<p>      He lied to his family about the retirement from the Sheriff’s office, when he actually had gotten laid off three years ago. His wife was the only one who knew. Michael, who was surrounded by his former co-workers, groaned and paced,leaving red streaks from his fingers across his face, walking in ovals and figure eights, shrieking every time he heard a plate crack in the next room. He picked up a baseball off the floor and threw it at the hood of his car. When they sat him down on a barstool in the living room, he bent his head down to his chest, and his body shook with his crying until he fell off the chair, scrunched up into a ball on the floor, holding the back of his head with his hands, his pale thighs revealed from the open robe. And he kept muttering, “Don’t call my wife, don’t call my wife, please.”</p>

<p>      It took eight hours for six men to move everything out of the house. And the rain kept falling, and all of Michael Grant’s possessions were scattered across the yard, as if the house threw up all it’s guts. Puddles were collecting on garbage bags, the television was filled with water and it’s screen sagged and then cracked from the weight.</p>

<p>      Maintenance guys smoked out in the street, “I know it’s tough, but you see all this shit,” he waved his palm out towards the yard, “There’s minimum fifteen thousand dollars in furniture. I just don’t get it. I don’t get it, and I don’t got any pity for the man either.”</p>

<p>      Michael tried to cover everything with bed sheets, but they didn’t stay down over all the little piles of objects and furniture and black garbage bags. By the time he called his family and a semi-truck came, it was too late.</p>

<p>      The maintenance guys and Ted and the sheriffs all stood in the street, waiting for that semi-truck to come. As Michael frantically tried to cover everything, he had taken off his robe to cover his daughter’s clothes, all the bed sheets, comforters, sleeping bags, were all spread out across the yard. But the wind kept flapping them, and Michael worked his way around the yard, just trying to keep it together for just one more moment.</p>
