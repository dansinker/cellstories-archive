<h2>Kissing Jess</h2>
	<h3>Sara Kerastas</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>I had been scrounging up the courage to admit this to my best friend Kath, for most of the way home, and it came out perfectly. “Just so you know, I would totally make out with Jess.” The words slipped out of my mouth, oh-so-nonchalant! As if I were saying I’d totally make out with that dude that just walked be, with the pants.  </p>

<p>We were walking along the main strip in Montreal, and before she could respond, a pack of Euro-sexual scene-sters red-rovered through our conversation, splitting us for half a block. It was a crisp, colorful spring afternoon and the street was brimming with promiscuous eye-contact. In Montreal, you see, the streets are charged like that. With every gender-bending haircut you pass, there is a short luxurious second of eye-sex, then straight back ahead. But it’s awesome. And with my tight pants, Gallouise cigarettes, and swoop-y shag mullet, my twenty-one-year-old self was trying so hard to just push out of the closet. When Kath and I finally weaved back into place, she looked unfazed.  </p>

<p>“Well, that’s funny” she countered, “cause Jess would totally make out with you.”  </p>

<p>I didn’t think I heard what she said, and Kath smiled at my silence, “Yup, she told me so.” </p>

<p>“What? Pssshno.… wait, really?” I had to clench my hands to keep them from wringing this information out of her. Kath was lapping it up. </p>

<p>“Yeah, a while ago, she was like ‘I’d totally make out with Sara.’”  </p>

<p>That’s me! I was this close to fist-pumping, Home Alone-style, but held back the giddy response with a cough. </p>

<p>“Hah. Wow, that’s funny, that we both, you know, want to do that…” </p>

<p>And that was it. I forced myself to change topics, but continued to digest the new information, floating the rest of the walk home. </p>

<p>Jess was one of those inherently cool people. You know those people – the ones that you can’t ever imagine not being cool. She was just a year or two out of the closet, and already had a reputation for being a lady-killer. Ice blue eyes. Asymmetrical haircut. She worked at this awesomely cool coffee shop-slash-bar-slash-art-gallery in Montreal called Café Esperanza. Café Hope. I would often go there on the chance that she was working, and order une allongé avec steamed soymilk. Then I’d sit there reading—pretending to read—while angling my cover of Gender Trouble in her direction, just so. I never got a reaction from Jess. </p>

<p>I know, what did I think was going to happen, right? Like showing her that I read Judith Butler would somehow pop my lady-cherry. This was Montreal! Everyone was fucking everyone else, and I hadn’t even kissed another girl, yet. But this new make-out information; this was gold. I had to do something about it. So, one night, I did. Sort of. </p>

<p>A couple weeks after that fateful walk home with Kath, I found myself drinking copious amounts of cheap red wine around Jess’s kitchen table. At twenty-one, this was a pretty average Thursday night. We were hanging out with a healthy selection of friends, post-dance-party, and Jess was sitting next to me. And our feet were touching under the table. There was no footsie going on – it was very subtle and normal, even, but we were totally touching. And we knew it. And neither one of us moved our feet! I was losing my shit with excitement. If this wasn’t a blatant invitation for sexy times, I didn’t know what was. </p>

<p>So, later that night, I was just trizz-ashed enough to do something. I didn’t know what exactly, but I was going to do…something. To let her know…something. As I was leaving to go home, I made sure that I said goodbye to Jess last. I did my rounds of hugs and kisses, and when I finally got to her, we hugged. And. I don’t really know how to describe what I did. You see it had to be inconspicuous and quick enough that no one else would notice, but at the same time a clear gesture of…something. </p>

<p>A neck-nuzzle?  </p>

<p>I swooped in, my cheek brushed up against hers, and there was definite neck-on-neck contact. Which doesn’t usually happen in quick friend-to-friend hugs! Come on, we’ve all pulled the awkward moves at least once in our lives. Sometimes they’re preplanned and thought out, but for me it was an impulsive, spur of the moment thing.  </p>

<p>I pulled out of the hug, and quickly gave everyone a last ‘peace out.’ As I turned around to open the door, I caught Jess out of the corner of my eye. She was standing very still. I think she’d gotten the message. Success. And with that, I slipped out the door, hopped down the stairs, and I ran as fast as my floppy drunken legs would take me, all the way home. Clearly, I was scared shitless and not at all ready to back up my something.  </p>

<p>That very weekend, there was something more. Two of our friends were hosting this epic post-finals party, and I was sure Jess was going to show. I arrived around ten-thirty, armed with a litre of table wine and shaky hands. There was something in me that night. Like the night before a trip, I couldn’t keep still.  </p>

<p>Within an hour or two, the party was roaring, and my empty litre of wine —read: the one my nerves knocked back in ninety minutes— sat on the crowded kitchen counter looking haggard.  </p>

<p>I was standing on the terrace talking to a friend when Jess entered my line of sight. Like tunnel-vision, I could see her walk into the kitchen maybe ten feet away, just off and to the left of where we were standing. “You see that girl?” I thought to myself, “You’re going to make out with her tonight.” I had decided in that very second. Thanks to the alcoholic vinegar I’d been pounding all night, I was sure of it.  </p>

<p>I pulled out a cigarette—you know, for the hands—and pretended to listen to the conversation around me. I flicked my eyes into the kitchen, now filled with people, and Jess turned her head. Looked directly at me, like magic. Our eyes locked across the swarm of figures, and I didn’t shy away from her gaze. Instead, I simply gestured for her to meet me outside. It was completely hidden. Part of some secret language. Pierced in eye contact, I just titled my head towards the front door. Like this. Then smiled. Then left.  </p>

<p>Pushing through that front door was like entering another world. The early morning air was dark and wet. A stark change from the sweaty pulse of the party inside. I plopped down on the neighbor’s stone stoop and found a cigarette in my fingers. Hey, I had forgotten about that little guy! I stuck him in my mouth, fished for my lighter, then sucked up a long awaited puff of smoke. The nicotine shot through my arms, straight up the back of my neck and into my head. My view of the street started to lag and scramble, so I threw the cigarette onto the cobblestones, when I heard something. </p>

<p>“Hey.” </p>

<p>My head turned towards the sound, and there was Jess, plopping herself down next to me on the stoop. Jess! Right! (I had completely forgotten why I was out there.)  </p>

<p>“Oh, hey! You came!” I goggled back to her, trying not to sound so surprised or wasted.   </p>

<p>I fumbled for something to say, and then I looked to my right and time slowed down, because Jess’s face was moving towards mine, eyes closed. It was like this whole other world coming towards me—one that I’d watched and fantasized about from afar but never thought would ever happen—coming right towards my face. Without thinking, I closed my eyes and joined her lips. And then, we were just… ma-king out!  </p>

<p>And it was so…awkward! She squirmed around my mouth in these unnatural spasmic ways – aggressively twisting over and around my teeth. She was tonguing my teeth! And I was just as bad, only the complete opposite. All tender and passionate, I actually reached over at one point and put my hand on her chest. No, not there. Higher. Like over her heart. And it just went on like this, both of us clearly trying to take control and guide the other person to our own styles, which were both grossly exaggerated by the sauce, and neither of us gave in! Fuck my rite of passage—this was a gong show! And by far the worst make out I’ve ever had it my life! </p>

<p>But I didn’t really have time to for all this to register, because I felt a warm surge of saliva flood my mouth, and I panicked. “Fuck. It was the stupid cigarette.” I should have known way better than to smoke a cigarette when I was already almost spinning. What was I thinking? That is the one thing guaranteed to send me over into vomit land.  And roughly two minutes before that’s going to happen, my mouth gushes with warm saliva from the back of my jaw. That very saliva was now being slopped and splashed into this potentially catastrophic make-out session. There was no stopping it, only pointing it in the right direction, which was definitely NOT Jess’s mouth. I jolted out of the make-out, stood up and forced out a sloppy, “let’s get back to the party.” I had maybe a minute left at this point.  </p>

<p>We stumbled into a narrow hallway packed with people. I teetered from side to side as my arms slid along both walls for support. My shoulder crash into the bathroom door, and I lunged myself into the tiny room. My knees hit the floor mat, I gulped down throat spasms, my time was up. </p>

<p>A few unconscious hours later, I pried my eyes open. Rays of early-morning-light cut through the haze hanging above my head from the recent night. As my mind slowly collected itself, I realized that I was on a queen-sized bed in the apartment. And I wasn’t alone. Six of my closest lady friends lay in the bed with me, on me and around me, their limp bodies tangled through mine. I had been the first on this bed, and was now the solid foundation for a lifeless cabin of drunken bodies. Flashes of the bathroom, a horizontal view of legs, and the sensation of cradling a garbage can shot through my memory. If my mouth could have tasted more alkaline and sour, it would have.  </p>

<p>But before I would find out that I had thrown up half a litre of pure red table wine into my friend’s bathtub and then her bedside garbage for round two. Before I was to eventually start a long, and torrid journey with the complexities of a queer relationship. Before I even knew what the hell I was doing, I laid on that bed and felt a soft hand touch my lower back. I held my breath. The hand gently lifted up my shirt and settled underneath it. I knew whom it belonged to, I didn’t have to look. She danced across my skin in a slow, soothing pattern. I exhaled.</p>

<p>And something happened: an adjustment, a mechanical shift. Like I’d just found… <i>something</i>. Something that I knew from somewhere—a familiar something. And through the jumbled heap of bodies, we stayed like that, connected as the sun rose. Or something.</p>
