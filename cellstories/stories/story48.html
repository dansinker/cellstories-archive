<h2>Oooohhhs and Aaaahhhhs</h2>

		</p><p>Elena Sophia.  </p>

<p>My little girl </p>

<p>Beautiful. Long dark curly hair.  Huge brown silly eyes. Waiting/ Watching/ Hoping/ Learning eyes.  She's all of three foot nuthin', has the soundtracks to Annie and Hairspray memorized, lives for adventure—mommy daughter adventures—breaks my little heart with her smile, and from the lips of my three year old's smile I hear— </p>

<p>"Mommy, sometimes I feel sexy. Is that bad?" </p>

<p>OHHHHHHHHH. aaaahhh. I don't... aaaaaaaahhhhhh uummmm. OK. OK. It's ok um. I want her to have ownership of her body; I don't want her to be taken advantage of. I want her to be confident... I ahh YES. YES. It's ok that you feel se...sex...no. NO. It is not OK. You are three. You don't have sexy bits. Curves don't even exist yet. I don't even let you play with Barbies. How did you learn that word? I...I...I don't know how to answer this question. And the truth is I'm not allowed to admit that I don't know how to answer this question because I AM THE MOMMY. And it is against the Mommy sisterhood to admit that you don't know something. To admit that I don't have the answer or I don't believe the answer, or I'm pretty sure I gave the wrong answer... </p>

<p>It is totally unfair that I have to answer this question. I want to beam myself back into the fifties when mothers could pretend they were all virgins in twin beds; and that their children were miracles... and I'm a liberal.  </p>

<p>Everything is a dialogue with a toddler. It is totally exhausting... but at least I can use it to figure out what I really think. To see if I can decipher what the true answer is and most of the time she is the insightful one. My little three year old. We're just looking for the answers together and I'm pretending I knew them all along. </p>

<p>Last October we’re pulling into a Walgreens parking lot in Skokie—you know Skokie full of kosher food and duplexes, boring but safe. A Jewish grandmother in every home imparting history and tenderness. But the parking lot is cold and gray stuffed with Nissans from the early nineties. The kind only grandmothers and pimps drive. It's Halloween and beautiful Elena is safely snapped in her car seat in the back wearing a forest fairy costume that we have been showing off to relatives all morning (Thank goodness my husband's family lives in Texas or I would have had to start showing her off a week ago). She's almost late for pre-school but we have to stop and get cash—because it's picture day and what kind of mother would I be if I didn't have a copy of her first school picture? </p>

<p>I stop the car just across from the door to the Walgreens, in front of a row of parked cars for a second so that my husband Tony can run in while we park and wait. If I could just take a moment: Tony my husband, HOT. I didn't settle. Oh no I didn't. Gorgeous clay colored skin. Full head of curly dark hair (Elena gets that from both sides). BIG features. I mean big. Big juju lips. Big Aztec nose. Fit. Loves to run. I'm an asthmatic, incapable of running but he's taking the jogging stroller out every day waving at neighbors as he glides by. Painter, drummer, actor, black belt (I'm not supposed to tell that one because it's a ninja secret, but now you know. So there.), and the boy can sing. SING. Makes the women cry and the men squirm because their women are crying. True story. Anyway he's in Walgreens taking out money and our daughter takes off her seat belt because she thinks she's going in with daddy. </p>

<p>"Oh sweetie, baby no baby. We've gotta put that back on, " I say contorting my body like an eleven year old in the circus trying to reach the belt when I hear, <i>HONK! HONK!<i> </i></i></p>

<p>"Oh sorry sorry." I say, giving the friendly driving wave. You know that wave. The <i>I didn’t realize I was blocking you/ sorry I cut you off/ whatever I did all will be forgiven because I’m giving you the it's all good WAVE</i>. "One minute please. One minute." <i>Wave</i>. </p>

<p>I look out the window and see a woman who is all hair, a mop of dark brittle hair with straggle of gray sticking out and she’s in a dirt colored 80s Chevy. It's a boat of a car and if you come up against it you loose. Her hair is all crazy like Rosanne Rossanna Danna and her skin is dried out like very pail leather. She looks really unhappy, like life has been really hard on her and I'm blocking her car—partially due to the size of her car, but I’m blocking it all the same. </p>

<p>“Sorry, sorry.” </p>

<p><i>HONK! HONK! HONK!</i></p>

<p>Oh, of course she can't hear me. I step out of the car and as I'm walking around to put my daughter's seat belt on and get out of her way I say with a smile and a wave, "Oh I'm so sorry. My daughter took her seatbelt off. I'm just going to put it back on and get out of your way. Sorry." I wave to the three-year-old in her back seat with a smile, and the lady responds, "MOVE YOUR FUCKING CAR!" </p>

<p>I would like to repeat: three-year-old in her back seat. Three-year-old in my back seat, and they're both staring at me. Mine is looking at me like, "Mommy, <i>fucking</i> is a bad word, aren't you going to give her a time-out?" And hers is looking at me like she's seen this before and I'm about to get my ass kicked.</p>

<p>"Please watch your language in front of the children. I will move it as soon as her seatbelt is on." I say smiling at Elena to show her I know how to handle this situation, I feel totally lost, but I have to handle this situation right in front of my daughter.  Elena looks convinced and that gives me enough confidence to keep going and I open the car door to fasten her seatbelt. </p>

<p>From behind me I hear in a screeching boom of a voice, "That's gonna take for fucking ever move your goddamned car." </p>

<p>I grab eyes with Lena to see if she caught the latest F-word. She did, and I reply condescendingly, " I'd be done already if you'd stop yelling. I'm going to put her seatbelt on and move the car." </p>

<p>And as she turns to get back into her car she says, and I quote... </p>

<p>"Stupid foreigner bitch." </p>

<p>My eyes burn. My heart pounds. My three year old is watching. Both three year olds are watching. It was one of those moment where sound stops and you feel like you being vacuum packed like a slab of meat. There is pressure on your heart and on your brain. </p>

<p>"Stupid foreigner bitch?" </p>

<p>I am not stupid, a foreigner, or a bitch. I'm Native American, baby. My great grandfather brought Piggly Wiggly to the Midwest, my great uncle invented bubble wrap. My grandfather designed the Pabst Blue Ribbon can. The Beer of the Working Class. A beverage that she has clearly had too much of this morning. My grandmother's family were the first family in their very American town of Ottawa Illinois to buy a Ford—America's freakin' car. I'm college educated, heck I'm a college educator and my English has been way better then hers thus far. I own a house. I married a wonderful man (blackbelt). Hello, functional family. We both work and raise our daughter who is dressed like a fairy for god's sake. My father was a black panther. I am DEEPLY rooted in America. </p>

<p>I take a deep breath and tap on her window lightly... intentionally light. And in a calm voice I say, "Excuse me miss, what did you say to me?" </p>

<p>She franticly reaches for her cell phone as if I'm a carjacker instead of a suburban mom and screams, "I'm calling the police." </p>

<p>I mean she is looking at me like I just broke out of Joliet maximum security. I'm about to get arrested in front of my three-year-old because of the color of my skin in 2008. </p>

<p>"Please be sure to tell them you called me a stupid foreigner bitch," I say politely at a loss for all other words. </p>

<p>I'm looking at my reflection. I know it's naive but I didn't know that people thought I was below them when they looked at me. I didn't think that burden was my generation's problem. Who does she see? Hasn't she noticed my Jetta. It's new. It's silver. I grew up a mile away in Evanston, the Mecca of diversity and open-mindedness. I'm dressed nice. I have a college degree that requires me to be eloquent. Then I see past my reflection and see my daughter looking at me waiting for an answer to the questions I am asking myself. I smile at her waiting eyes and I turn back around to face this woman's crazed ones, because in this moment she is easier to face then Elena. </p>

<p>My husband Tony is coming up behind me now and asking, "What's going on?", and I have to say, "I really don't know." The woman is circling our car like a buzzard screaming into the phone, "silver Jetta, 4 door, license plate number..." Describing my car as if I've assaulted her. My daughter is watching and I do not have the answer. Then she leaves her child in the car and bolts into the store. </p>

<p>"Are you going to leave your child alone?" I shout after her. </p>

<p>Tony puts Elena's seatbelt on and moves the car. I stay by the boat locked eye-to-eye with her child who looks as if this is all routine to her. The screeching voice comes bustling out with a tall lanky mild mannered manger who looks annoyed as he eyes me standing alone in the center of the parking lot. I pull together my composure and tell him the whole story, while cars slowly pull around us, he turns calmly to her and says, "Mam she couldn't drive the car if the child didn't have on her safety belt." Right. I think that's right. Score one for me. I feel my fight of flight response lesson, as I realize that someone other then me just exhibited some sort of normalcy; and then the screech kicks it back into gear, "She abandoned her child in the car!" the lady shouts out. </p>

<p>To which I point out that my husband is with her but she clearly left her daughter alone when she went into the store, and the manager says, "That's true mam." Yes! two for me zero for crazy screeching lady. She runs to her car ranting and raving the whole way and tares out of the parking lot. OK. OK. I won. I didn't lose it. My daughter saw me keep it together and I won. </p>

<p>I slide back into my car, take the first breath I can remember taking in the last ten minutes, and from the back I hear... </p>

<p>"Mommy are you ok? Mama why did she say that? What did she mean?” </p>

<p>Tony meets my eyes as I turn to face Elena, just a moments glance to tell me that he backs me up, but he’s leaving it to me to answer. Now I have to teach my daughter why someone would treat our family this way. I don't understand it, I don't think I'll ever understand it. Once we’ve dropped Elena off at school and Tony and I are alone I’ll ask him the same questions, "Why did she say that to me? What did she mean?" And he’ll try to explain it to me in a dialogue filled with uuummms, ooohhhs and aaahhhs; and I’ll realize that it really isn't what he says but just the fact that he's there to say it. That he cares enough to figure it out with me; but for now with Elena watching I turn around and I smile and I start the dialogue. "Well baby, uumm, well ahhhh," I try to remember what my dad always told me. How he put it," aaaahhhh...ok. The world is full of ignorant people. For many different reasons they never learned how to treat others, but no matter what happens you never give up your future for their ignorance. You know who you are even when they don't." </p>

<p>I smile at her with all of the warmth that she brings and say, "I love you." </p>

<p>"Love you too. Can we go to school now?" </p>

<p>"Yeah baby." </p>
