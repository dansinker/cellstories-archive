		</p><p>It was New Year’s Eve—not this past year, but the one before—and my night truly began when I sat down at the Charleston Bar in Bucktown.  It was my first time there but that one night has kept me coming back throughout the past year and a half.  I dig the ever-rotating supply of local art on the walls, the pool table in the back and the broke down piano that would make Tom Waits proud.  But last New Year’s Eve, I just needed a good place to get real drunk. </p>

<p>Around 10pm that night, I happened upon the Charleston.  I took a seat and demanded a shot of Patron from the bartender.  A heavy set man—forties, beer gut, nonplused—he slipped over to me with my tequila.  He leaned back against the bar and folded his arms over his Carhart vest. </p>

<p>“What brings you here tonight?” he asked.  I was woefully over dressed for the Charleston—neatly pressed button down, over coat, cashmere scarf—but I was determined to show I belonged.  I stared that bartender down, slammed the shot and barked, “I’m here to get drunk.” </p>

<p>“Okay,” he said, refilling my glass.  “But why here?” </p>

<p>I paused, let out a long and low sigh, propped my elbow on the bar and rested my head on my hand.  “Cuz I just got dumped.” </p>

<p>I know—it’s the mother of all clichés—recently broken-hearted gets plastered in lonely bar.  But when you’re living it, it’s not a cliché.  It’s an excuse to not be alone. </p>

<p>“Whatever,” I said, unloading my second shot.  “She’s a fucking bitch anyway.”  Ladies, please, forgive me.  My emotional state was all over the map—bruised one minute, angry the next, I had no where to go and only tequila to turn to.  I mean. . .like. . .getting dumped sucks.  And getting dumped on New Year’s Eve, on the most magical night of the year, on the way to a party with your girlfriend?  That sucks a lot. </p>

<p>See, about a half hour before wandering into the Charleston, I stood outside the 7-Eleven on Damen in Bucktown with Jane, my then-girlfriend.  She held my hand lightly, her knee-high boots flecked with falling snow, hipster-girl bangs wet against her forehead while she looked up at me and whispered, “I don’t want to do this anymore,” before she turned and wandered into the white.  We were on our way to a party, but it wasn’t just any house party with high-fivin’ frat guys and shriek-y blond girls.  No, it was a grown-up affair hosted by some friends of Jane’s who owned a home and a wicked champagne collection.  And a whole fantasy for my perfect New Year’s Eve was laid out in my mind—a golden and warm apartment filled with candles and holiday decorations where we would sip Veuve Cliquot from pristine champagne flutes, the sound of popping bottles mixing with laughter and soft music.  And just before the New Year, I would pull Jane into a dark corner of the apartment, look into her soft blue eyes, kiss her delicate mouth and whisper, “Happy New Year, baby.” </p>

<p>I know that sounds silly but that’s what we all want, to experience something wonderful, maybe even magical as the clock strikes midnight.  But I had lived too much inside my perfect fantasy and doing so had allowed me to ignore the sense of impending doom that had circled our relationship and led to our snow-drenched break-up. </p>

<p>Now, I look back at Jane and I scoff.  I mean, it wasn’t even anything real, just a petty two-people-fuck-after-work-all-the-time tryst.  But in the moment, as I had watched her walk away from me and down Damen towards the party, that bitch tarnished every last image of my perfect fantasy and ruined me so fucking completely that I honestly thought I never wanted to be with another woman ever again.  So I decided to get shit-faced.  You would have done the same thing too. </p>

<p>The Charleston bartender set me up with a third shot of tequila and a band started to play behind me.  I looked over my shoulder, taking in my surroundings for the first time.  Candles graced every surface, from the tables to the bar to the window sills, and the main space was dotted with low-slung tables and chairs.  Some fifteen or so folks were nestled around a cluster of musicians who had set up shop near the piano, about ten feet away from me.  All of them were about twenty years older than me, and they looked like they loved Old Style and hard work.  A man with spectacles and a white pepper beard played an acoustic guitar on his knee; next to him were an old weathered woman who held an upright base and a tall Ichabod Crane-looking troubadour who plunked away at the piano.  They played an old country ballad—honest and pure—and they were surprisingly good.  I ordered my first beer of the night and drank it in silence.  I smiled and listened. </p>

<p>By the third beer, I was really enjoying the music, tapping my toes to some mid-tempo number.  I leaned over to the bartender in amazement.  “This band is really good,” I told him. </p>

<p>He adjusted his Cubs hat slightly and nodded.  “I know,” he said. </p>

<p>I looked at the other old-timers, men and women hugging and laughing and pounding back drinks.  They looked like they were having a blast.  For a moment, I lost myself, forgot my anger and just watched the band play. </p>

<p>I turned back to the bartender.  “So is this like, uh, a special New Year’s thing or something?” I asked. </p>

<p>“Oh, hell, no” he said, chuckling.  “These people don’t care about New Year’s Eve.  For them, it’s just Monday.” </p>

<p>By beer number six, I was drunk, but it wasn’t the mean and nasty intoxication I had expected, but rather the euphoric kind of drunk, the I-can’t-believe-I’m-enjoying-myself-here-but-also-I-can’t-stand-up-cuz-I’ll-fall-over-kind-of-drunk.  You know what I’m talkin’ about.  But I remember what happened next went like this: the band finished their set with a rock’n’roll classic and I looked at my watch.  It read 11:59pm.  And as I took a moment to reflect on my night, my break-up with Jane and the sheer strangeness of passing into the New Year at the Charleston, I heard it: TAP tap tap tap, TAP tap tap tap, the sound of glass on a wood table top.  I didn’t know what it was at first but I would soon know it as the drum beat from one of the most famous songs in rock’n’roll history.  Despite my own ignorance, however, White Pepper—the guitarist of the band and so named only in my head because of his beard—he knew right away. </p>

<p>“Awww, man,” he said smiling.  “I’m not playing that tonight.  We’re done here and I don’t even have any drums.” </p>

<p>“Come on,” the bottle tapper yelled back.  “You know you want to!” </p>

<p>“Yeah, let’s hear it,” an Old Style-guzzling man called out and some of the others joined in.  “Play it, man.”  “Let’s go.”  “We’re not leaving here til ya do!” </p>

<p>Finally, White Pepper broke down.  “Okay, everybody shut up,” he said.  And without any fanfare, skillfully and deftly, he broke out into the intro.  A roar went up from the small crowd.  I sat up on my bar stool in excitement.  I mean, it’s the best song on the planet.  And then the band kicked in.  It was unlike any version that Mick and Keith had ever played.  With no drums, it was a performance made of spare parts, a rollicking, boogie-woogie groove kept together by the piano player’s swinging black and white keys.  White Pepper sang harmony with the bassist, but they could barely be heard cuz everybody else—all fifteen or so revelers, the bartender, even me—joined in and carried the tune, a loud and warbling affair.  Everybody tapped their feet and as the song progressed, I saw someone pick up a bar stool and pound on the floor, the beat mixing perfectly with the melody.  Someone else joined along, standing and lifting their own chair off the ground and pretty soon everybody was in on the action, bar stools and tables and beer glasses served up as the broken percussion for a fractured song.  I took in the whole room then, the swirling snow outside, the frost on the windows, the people in front of me laughing and being together and it just blew me away.  There was the wonderful and magical moment I had wanted all night, in a place I never even thought to look.   </p>

<p>The band segued to a rousing finish.  Guitar and bass and piano just died away but the rhythm kept going, coaxing itself out, pounding into the ether.  And then, in one precise instant, it all stopped.</p>
