<h2>The Celebrity Orders Room Service</h2>
	<h3>Dave Housley</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>The celebrity answers the door herself. “Fucking publicist is making a Starbucks run,” she says. She strides into the darkness of the suite. There is an insouciance to her walk, the careless authority of an alpha hyena leading her clan across the savanna. The interviewer pauses. This room costs more per night than six months of payments on the Honda. He sucks a breath and follows the celebrity’s skinny ass down the hallway, past piles of clothes, unopened packages, empty bottles, and full ashtrays. The celebrity sinks into a couch. She opens a bottle of water, reads a message on her phone. “So?” she says.</p>

<p>The interviewer has been given very strict guidelines – he is to focus on the album, he is not to discuss the sex tape, the issue of panties and proper technique for exiting an automobile, the failed TV pilot, or the “thing with Lindsay.” The interviewer is from a small arts magazine, not necessarily obscure, but still, not the kind of gig that regularly sees him stepping into the mauve cocoon of the Chateau Marmont. </p>

<p>“So?” the celebrity says again. “Are you going to fucking start asking questions or what?” She is tiny, wiry even, with a bad energy about her, like a short sailor a few hours into a bender.    </p>

<p>“Are you hungry?” the celebrity says. “I'm fucking starving. Let's order room service.”
<br>  
<br><h4>* * *</h4>   </p>

<p>The celebrity is different from us. Her heart beats faster. Her blood, thinner. Arms, legs, torso, ankles, fingers, all more delicate than most children. Although she weighs less than one hundred pounds, the celebrity's head is significantly larger than yours or mine.  </p>

<p><h4>* * *</h4> </p>

<p>Room service arrives. The celebrity has ordered smoked salmon, two pancakes, roast chicken with black truffles, fresh kiwi, three orders of ahi tuna, onion rings, a bottle of Clos du Mesnil, three cans of Red Bull, four t-bones, and a grilled fennel and mushroom omelette. “Do you have any money?” she asks the interviewer. The bellman stands erect by the door.</p>

<p>“Um....” the interviewer stammers. He has forty dollars in his wallet. He gets paid six days from now. He has two hundred and ten dollars to last six days. This should not be a problem. He is comfortable. The work at the magazine pays well for what it is, even if he is forced to rent in a less fashionable part of the city.</p>

<p>The celebrity smiles. The interviewer remembers what a bad actress the celebrity is. He has seen the TV pilot. He knows a little about the celebrity, the sharp bark of her laugh, what she is likely to say later on, in the limo, on her way to one place or another. He looks at the room service cart. Surely this is more than two hundred and ten dollars, more than five hundred, maybe a thousand. How much does a bottle of Clos du Mesnil cost, room service? “Not really,” he says, patting his wallet. “Not on me.”</p>

<p>“No money at all?” The celebrity speaks like a supervisor who has caught him in a lie. There is a punchline in her voice, as if she’s gained some kind of advantage, like a courtroom lawyer about to shout “Aha!”</p>

<p>The interviewer feels the heat rise to his cheeks. “No money at all,” he says. “Do you?”  
<br>     
<br>“Do I?” the celebrity says. Her eyes register disbelief. She smiles, snorts a laugh. “Fucking. What? Do I?” She shifts in her chair, jumping closer. The interviewer knows all about body language, but he cannot help himself: he pulls back.</p>

<p><h4>* * *</h4></p>

<p>The celebrity has spent very little of her young life waiting. She is rarely stuck in traffic, is almost never required to linger in any kind of queue. She has never seen the inside of a Department of Motor Vehicles, hasn’t been in a grocery store for a decade. If she could change anything about Los Angeles, it would be to quadruple the size of the women's bathroom in the Mondrian.  </p>

<p><h4>* * *</h4></p>

<p>The celebrity makes several calls from while the interviewer waits. The publicist is stranded on Sunset. Other people are not answering. Nobody has money, not actual money. “Fuck, okay,” the celebrity says. She nods her head, as if she is trying to convince herself. “I'll just call the number. It'll be cool.”</p>

<p>“The number?” the interviewer says.</p>

<p>She pauses, makes a face. She is young. The interviewer knew this coming in. But she is also tiny. She is a child. “Um...yeah...the number,” she says, as if she is describing the most obvious thing in the world. She fishes in her Balenciaga bag, seizes on a card, a single phone number printed in large type. She punches the digits into the phone. “It's me,” she says, her voice ratcheting smoothly into a register the interviewer might call sweet. “I need more money.”  </p>

<p><h4>* * *</h4></p>

<p>In the back of the celebrity's mind, every now and then, doubt flickers like a dying firefly. Why am I famous? What do I actually do? How long can this possibly last? This happens very infrequently, almost always after she has come into direct contact with Bono or Angelina Jolie.</p>

<p><h4>* * *</h4> </p>

<p>“I need to what?” the celebrity shouts into the phone. “With who?” She sits up. For the first time, she looks legitimately concerned. This countenance does not fit well. It is, the interviewer thinks, like one of those little girls in a beauty contest, shaking her ass in some kind of imitation of an imitation of something. She covers the phone with a tiny hand. “Who is Manu Ginobli?” she says.</p>

<p>The interviewer smiles. What game is the celebrity playing? “He plays for the San Antonio Spurs.”</p>

<p>“The San Antonio fucking Spurs!” the celebrity yells at the phone. “Like I'm gonna date a fucking San Antonio Spur!”</p>

<p>“He's pretty good,” the interviewer says.</p>

<p>“At least somebody from the Lakers,” the celebrity says. The other party is still talking. “Ten pounds?” she says. “Ten? Fuck, how am I gonna gain ten pounds?” The interviewer can hear the other end of the line – a deep, calm, male voice, like an old time movie star. “Fifteen? Fuck! No, okay – no talking back. Fifteen pounds? Do you know what I'm gonna have to do to gain fifteen pounds?”</p>

<p><h4>* * *</h4></p>

<p>The celebrity has always been a celebrity. She is the child of a singer and an actor. She is, one could say, to the tabloids born. When she sees herself in US Weekly or InTouch, on Hollywood Extra or Access Hollywood, Gawker or Defamer or Perezhilton.com, it is as natural as looking at the back of her own hand.</p>

<p>When she looks at these magazines and tabloids, the gossip websites and late night comedy shows, and does not see herself, her smartass grin, grinning right back at her, the effect is jarring, like looking into a perfectly blank mirror.  </p>

<p><h4>* * *</h4></p>

<p>“Is that how it always works?” the interviewer says. He wishes, just for a brief moment, that he had some kind of accent. Australian would be nice. “With the money?”</p>

<p>“What?” the celebrity says. “No. Sometimes. I mean, the number is always different.”</p>

<p>“Who gives you the number?”</p>

<p>“This is a hard one, though. I mean, fuck, how am I going to gain fifteen pounds?”</p>

<p>“So when you call…” The interviewer trails off. I’m on to something, he thinks. This might be the key: write a few thousand words, maybe sell something to Esquire, finally, or the New Yorker.</p>

<p>“Like I’m gonna give you the number.” The celebrity is typing on her phone again, making a face. “How do you spell fucking Ginobli?” she says. “Fuck!”</p>

<p>“It must be hard, what they ask you to do,” he says.</p>

<p>“What? That?” She is checking her phone again, clicking through messages or numbers or contacts, her fingers pecking away. “It is what it is. I mean, I wouldn't want, you know, the opposite.” </p>

<p>The interviewer looks at the plasma televisions hung on every wall, at the expensive creams and unopened shopping bags that line the hallway. I could get used to this, he thinks. He sinks back into the plush softness of the sofa, puts his feet up on the divan. “What?” he says.</p>

<p>“The opposite,” the celebrity says. She giggles, shakes her head affectionately. The celebrity, the interviewer decides, is very pretty. Small and too skinny, yes, but the way her hair cascades over her shoulders is captivating.</p>

<p>“I’m not following,” the interviewer says, smiling. They are clicking. Something about her is undeniably attractive.</p>

<p>“The opposite of famous,” she says. “Just another asshole. Like you.”</p>
