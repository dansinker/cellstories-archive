<h2>Fina’s Dream</h2>
	<h3>Jill Widner</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p> Mina’s mouth is stained bright red. What looks to the girl like a slick-skinned fibrous nut is lodged between her gums and cheek, packed there, so that the side of her face looks swollen. She is chewing, and her lips and her teeth and the spaces in between her teeth are coated with red-brown saliva and bits of what look like masticated bark. From time to time she reaches into her mouth, removes the partially chewed wad and spits into the dirt between her feet.  Some of the juice she swallows; some of it she holds in her cheek.  She spits again and returns the chewed nut to her mouth.</p>

<p>      Fina, the Filipina girl who lives down the road, is showing Elizabeth how to make a necklace from the purple stem of the ubi plant that grows in the dirt against a concrete wall. Elizabeth is trying to imitate the way Fina snaps the stem and strips the skin in a stair-step pattern, but her stem keeps breaking and she has to begin again. </p>

<p>      "What is ubi?" Elizabeth asks.</p>

<p>      "Something like potato. Indonesian potato." </p>

<p>      Elizabeth is distracted by what Mina is doing.  She knows it isn’t blood that Mina is spitting, but it looks like blood. Her eyes are distant. She has stopped talking. </p>

<p>      "What is she eating?" Elizabeth whispers.</p>

<p>      "She isn’t eating, she’s chewing.  You know the short palm trees that grow along the river wall in Kampung Baru?"</p>

<p>      "The ones near the new pool?"</p>

<p>      Fina nods. "It is betel nut, the fruit of the betel palm.  Old women like it."</p>

<p>      "Why?"</p>

<p>      Fina shrugs. "Maybe it is something like medicine."</p>

<p>      Elizabeth likes Fina’s voice. It is soft. Quiet and husky at the same time, like a boy’s voice. </p>

<p>      "I think it makes them dream while they are awake. Do you remember your dreams?"</p>

<p>      Elizabeth pauses to think.  "Do you?"</p>

<p>      "Yes." Fina looks at her.  "I’ve dreamed of you."</p>

<p>      "You have?"</p>

<p>      "I saw you inside my house."</p>

<p>      "I’ve never been to your house."</p>

<p>      "You must have. Or else you will. That is how it is with dreams.  Everything has already happened. Or else it will happen."</p>

<p>      "How do you know that?"</p>

<p>      "I just know."</p>

<p>      "What was I doing?"</p>

<p>      "Nothing. Just standing there. In the kitchen, I think.  You looked afraid.  I think you were afraid you were going to have to eat our food.  Have you ever played tennis?"</p>

<p>      "No."</p>

<p>      "It’s fun to go to the courts at night. Especially if the moon is out. And it will be tonight. Do you want to?"</p>

<p>      Fina is kneeling on the kitchen floor, retying the laces of her tennis shoes when she remembers the tennis racquets.  Elizabeth waits on the back step, the screen door propped open on her elbow. She smells something scorched. A rancid smell, a residue hanging in the air, a film coating all of the surfaces in the room. It is the smell that comes from the belakang when Mina cooks on the propane stove. </p>

<p>      On the other side of the room, the Indonesian cook turns around, less to look at the white girl than at the door she is holding open. She says nothing. Turns back to the dishes she is washing in the sink. </p>

<p>      Elizabeth glances through the glass louvers that are tilted open, high on the wall near the ceiling.  The twilight is gone from the sky. It is dark now.  From a room at the front of the house, she hears a radio. A few bars of metallic-sounding music, interrupted intermittently by the muffled sound of a voice speaking in a monotone. She looks around the room.  Paper ornaments dangle from the ceiling.  They swing in the breeze from the fan.  On the wall, a calendar. <i>Shell Oil Company</i>, Elizabeth reads. A barefoot, bare-chested white boy with white-blonde hair stares from the photograph for the month of July. His shorts are loose and long.  A white feathered cockatoo with a yellow comb is balanced on his shoulder. </p>

<p>      Fina is back. She hands one of the racquets to the white girl. The screen door slams behind them, and they’re walking in the dark, gravel crushing beneath the soles of their shoes.  Across the street from the tennis courts, a diving board and the deck of a swimming pool are visible behind a tall wire fence. Elizabeth’s brother and his friends call it the old pool. She hears her brother’s voice in her head as they pass: <i>No one swims in the <i>old</i> pool.  Look at the tile. Look at the water.  It smells like the swamp.</i>   </p>

<p>      Elizabeth’s mother uses the word physique to describe the nice looking bodies of boys. <i>Your brother has a nice physique</i>, she says. This is the word Elizabeth thinks of watching Fina, crouched boy-like on half bent knees behind the net.  Long, strong arms and legs. Long, strong waist and back.  Her long black hair and the attitude of her shoulders make the girl think of the broad, confident strokes of a magic marker across a sheet of brown construction paper.<i>Fina has a nice physique</i>, she thinks. </p>

<p>      "Watch," Fina says. "Like this. Grasp the racquet here, as though you want to shake its hand." From her crouch, in slow motion, she steps back and swings back her arm. "Unlock the door. Close the door. Turn the key. You try." </p>

<p>      Fina is older than Elizabeth. She might be eleven.  She might be twelve. "Let’s climb on the roof," she says. Fina leads Elizabeth behind the building, where an open concrete staircase leads to a flat roof. It is dark on the roof.</p>

<p>      "I like to sit in the dark," Fina says. "Do you?"</p>

<p>      "I don’t know."</p>

<p>      "Are you afraid?"</p>

<p>      "I don’t know."</p>

<p>      "You don’t have to be. I come here with my sister all the time. No one comes up here. Only us."</p>

<p>      Fina finds a place that looks clean enough and sits down.  She brushes the concrete floor with her hand and pats the ground. Elizabeth sits down beside her.  Fina leans back against the concrete wall, her long bare legs stretched out in front of her. </p>

<p>      "Look," Fina says. She points through the branches of a monkey pod tree. "I told you." The moon is a yellow-brown disc that appears to be rising out of the river. "Can you smell the river?"</p>

<p>      Elizabeth sniffs at the air.</p>

<p>      "Have you ever noticed there is more to smell in the dark?" </p>

<p>      Elizabeth hasn’t, but recognizes now that it’s true.</p>

<p>      Fina unties her tennis shoes. "Take off your shoes. Barefoot feels better."</p>

<p>      Elizabeth pulls off her shoes and socks. She scuffs the soles of her feet against the concrete floor. </p>

<p>      "I remembered something else about the dream."</p>

<p>      Hours have passed.  Elizabeth has forgotten the dream.</p>

<p>      "You climbed under a table. Do you like horses?"</p>

<p>      "Why?"</p>

<p>      "There was a herd of horses under the table.  Really small horses.  Maybe they were dogs, but I think they were horses.  Their faces were long like horses.  You were explaining the best way to approach a shy animal. You put out your hand.  You said, <i>You have to wait for them to come to you</i>. Then you said, <i>Well, usually this works.  Unless they bite.</i> Something like that."</p>

<p>      "You dreamed that much about me?"</p>

<p>      Fina nods.</p>

<p>      Fina is watching the moon, her shoulders and head propped against the wall.</p>

<p>      Elizabeth is sitting cross-legged beside her, barefoot in a loose pair of shorts. </p>

<p>      "Lie down like me."</p>

<p>      Elizabeth is relaxed now. "Your legs are longer than mine."</p>

<p>      Fina moves closer until the side of her brown leg is touching the side of the white girl’s leg.  ‘Longer by a lot.’  Fina lifts her foot.  Rests it on top of Elizabeth’s ankle. </p>

<p>      Elizabeth hears herself swallow. </p>

<p>      "Look at the moon," Fina says. "Gilang-cemerlang."</p>

<p>      Fina’s voice is soft.  It sounds the way it always sounds, quiet and husky at the same time, like a boy’s voice. </p>

<p>      "What did you say?"</p>

<p>      "Gilang-cemerlang. The moon. It is so glittery.  It is so bright."</p>

<p>      Fina’s fingers move back and forth against the rough cotton fabric of Elizabeth’s shorts.  Her fingers reach for the hem. The heel of her bare foot rubs against Elizabeth’s ankle. </p>

<p>      Elizabeth watches Fina’s toes. It is as if they’re breathing.  It is as if they’re speaking. Or singing.</p>

<p>      The moon hangs over their heads, more yellow now than brown. Fina lifts her long black hair off the back of her neck, shakes it away from her shoulders. "Have you ever tried that before?"</p>

<p>      The white girl shakes her head no.</p>

<p>      "You have your racquet?"</p>

<p>      "Yes."</p>

<p>      "Let’s run."</p>
