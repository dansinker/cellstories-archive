<h2>Resting</h2>
	<h3>Niven Govinden</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>She needs him. A neighbour leaves another filthy message complaining about the noise and she doesn’t know how to delete it from the machine. Its presence, a thirty-second blip of residential gripe recorded onto a memory chip, weighs heavily. He deletes the message remotely, using the PIN number he’s kept from her. Doesn’t bother to listen past the first few seconds. No point. He has found there is little variety in the neighbourly expression of dissatisfaction: surprised and affronted, good diction, pissed. </p>

<p>      By the time he arrives what has been described as ‘further unacceptable racket, from an inconsiderate fucking whore’ has stopped, leaving a snatched silence down the mews they have recently moved her to. Impervious to swift changes in British weather conditions, a wireless midi speaker sits on the window ledge, the bringer of sound-system culture to Belgravia homeowners and their staff.</p>

<p>      He asks the lads outside what she was playing. By all accounts it was a good mash-up: Phil Spector, Adam and the Ants, Sugarhill Gang. They had a bop even if the nosy neighbours didn’t.</p>

<p>      ‘Get anything?’</p>

<p>      ‘Couple of frames when she stuck her head out the window giving some shoulder movements. She hadn’t combed her hair but she looked cute. Fresh, like. They’ll probably use them tomorrow if nothing major breaks overnight.’</p>

<p>      The lads are packing up for the day. They’re needed elsewhere in town, knowing that his presence is guaranteed to nix any further incident.</p>

<p>      The flat is no different to how he left it this morning; that is to say, clean, with no signs of paraphernalia, no guests. The bathroom remains hotel-neat. Neither soap nor toothbrush has been touched. The bedroom curtains are drawn, as they are throughout the apartment, the bed roughly made, the sole example of her domestic duty. The dishwasher is empty, the fridge untouched. The bin tells the story of what has fed her: juice, unsalted vegetable crisps, and the last knuckle of stale baguette.</p>

<p>      George lies on the sofa covered in a Snoopy blanket</p>

<p>&#8212Do you hear it? - she calls. Did you hear what he was saying to me?</p>

<p>      The restive stance is nothing more than a front; from a canon of tricks taught at stage-school, and later practised on feeble photographers and television directors. It is not his job to be as adoring. He was brought into her life to cover her in beige.</p>

<p>&#8212Since when is a man allowed to speak to a woman like that? 
<br>&#8212The music may have pushed him to the edge, George. He’s a pensioner, I think.
<br>&#8212He hates black people.
<br>&#8212You’re not black, George.
<br>&#8212He hates black music, then. Anyone who hates black music is a racist
<br>&#8212Listen, it was the more the issue of the loudspeaker playing music across the street. Did it need to be so loud? I thought we’d talked about this before.</p>

<p>The tension in her face dissipates. Now there is only mischief.</p>

<p>&#8212I had to give the boys some tunes. They get bored to tears standing all day in this graveyard street.
<br>      She’s begged to leave the flat, for days the same request, but he refuses her. Knows she isn’t ready. He has visions of her doing a runner from the corner shop, or breaking out through the crowd at Hyde Park Corner, disappearing. George too has the same visions. It’s all over her face every time she asks him. Since his arrival, contingencies have been put into place to avoid the possibility, namely two security guys they’ve posted at the top of the mews posing as fans in twelve hour shifts.</p>

<p>      As she folds away the Snoopy blanket, stashing it in the open mouth of the ottoman in the space where the TV used to be, he sees that she is still wearing the same clothes she’s worn for the last five days: oversized flannel PJs and a fluffy dressing gown. The socks are fresh, green from yesterday’s blue, and match the polka dots on PJs. This is the kind of details he notes in his journal: a dot-to-dot of small changes that add up to gradual, eventual progress. It will make for cheering reading for those who will read his report tonight.</p>

<p>&#8212Can we go out? You could take me to see that play you were talking about, the other day.
<br>&#8212A month ago. Closed last week.
<br>&#8212I’m thick. It takes time for ideas to work their way in.
<br>&#8212You would have enjoyed it.
<br>&#8212Then don’t rub my nose in it, now that I can’t see it! Can we do something else instead? Doesn’t have to be a play. Shops or something.
<br>&#8212Shops are shut.
<br>&#8212What about the one at the top of the main road?
<br>&#8212Not a petrol station, George. They don’t like any fuss on the forecourt after last time.</p>

<p>      He fishes out a box from the ottoman, buried under blankets and emergency towels. Rattles the contents close to her ear like it’s the borrowed jewellery she wears and loses at awards shows.</p>

<p>&#8212We haven’t played this for a few days. Would give me an opportunity to redeem myself.
<br>&#8212I’m not playing bloody Connect 4, Barrow. I want to go out!
<br>&#8212It’s difficult. I already let the driver go.
<br>&#8212Who was it, Preston? Preston’ll come back for me.
<br>&#8212Preston’s away. We’ve got Raymond for the week.
<br>&#8212That miserable sod ain’t gonna do any favours for me. Can’t we get rid of him?
<br>&#8212He’s paid to be a driver, which he’s very good at. He’s not there to be your best friend.
<br>&#8212Ha! That’s your job.
<br>      
<br>She is taking longer than scheduled to fall into line. That they are four weeks from where they should be, depresses him, and limits the opportunity to collect his bonus. Barrow is unused to failure of this kind. Even with his more challenging projects he was not as drained as he is with George. Her resistance is stronger. None of the others talked back the way she does. He continues to see the dissent in her eyes and looks to kill it. Only when he has beaten her will she have understood that she cannot have a say over everything. That despite what she may think, this illusion of independence, paymasters must be answered to.</p>

<p>      He lets her play with her toys. Under the agreement she can have one hour’s supervised internet access per day, although nothing can be sent. In the beginning this was a fight, now she understands the drill. Googles herself compulsively as a spectator to her own career. Lurks on messageboards and tweets. Snorts at their kind-heartedness and good wishes</p>

<p>&#8212Look at these tossers. Think they have the answer to everything.
<br>&#8212They’ve paid for this flat, George. For my services too, if you think about it.
<br>&#8212That’s enough to make me want to champion bankruptcy. I despise them almost as much as I do you.
<br>      
<br>She hates him. Everything about his cheerful, tenacious, ways makes her want to puke. She wonders which events, failures in his have life, brought him to this sorry-arse career. She hopes it was something major, a spectacular fall from grace. Some gut-ripping disappointment that really, really hurt.</p>

<p>      She has heard rumours that he fucks his prisoners at the end of their ‘quiet’ time, to mark their release. She hears him at night, standing in her bedroom doorway, an hour after she’s had the herbal tea loaded with sedatives, each time wondering whether this will be it. Whether she’s done enough, complied, said sorry enough times. She is more than ready. Anything for this to be over.</p>

<p>&#8212Listen to this one. ‘Stay strong. You’re one of our country’s great talents.’ What a load of crap!
<br>      
<br>Even they can see what she can’t, as she lies on the sofa and rots in her pants and questions the legality of having her finances frozen. But, it’ll come. He knows there will be a moment, a year, two years from now, where she will spot his face at a gig, or seated at the back row of some film premiere, and run over to thank him. Her face will be a picture of contentment, fully aware of the bullshit circus surrounding her, but comfortable enough to deal with it. Strong enough to control it and call the shots. Her legs won’t be able to reach him quick enough. Some have thanked him on CD booklets, or in the tiniest print as the film credits roll, positioned between catering trucks and location security. She will thank him in person. Already he knows this. She is unafraid. </p>
