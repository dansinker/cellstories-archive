<h2>The Spoils of the Fair</h2>
	<h3>Paul Hornschemeier</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>I've lived here for a while, about four years, but there are still boxes that I've yet to unpack. This isn't an isolated fact. Since I left my parents' house in Southern Ohio, I've always managed to leave something for later, never fully giving over to wherever I'd set myself down. I moved each year and the un-unpacked boxes moved with me. </p>

<p>   Granted, in the four years I've lived here, in the same apartment, the amount of permanently packed boxes has dwindled, but there are still two boxes left, shoved behind a door. Occasionally I note the boxes, then promptly forget them.</p>

<p>   Another reality in my everyday living: I am scatterbrained. This has gotten worse over the years. When I was fifteen or sixteen I noticed my head feeling differently and I started to freely associate words and events a bit too freely for normal conversation. Also I started masturbating a lot more, but I think that was because of Christie Klein.</p>

<p>   I usually speak with a solid point in mind, but some word will have an interesting neighbor in my head, and a new idea will take precedence. In listening to the few of my conversations recorded on well-meaning videos of family events, I feel a mix of embarrassment and gratitude that my family has yet to institutionalize me.</p>

<p>   Still, my brain comes in handy sometimes. When I am faced with a deadline or an actual decision, television can go only so far as a distraction. But my brain houses an endless repertoire of buried to-do lists and dutifully produces obstacles to combat the looming commitment.</p>

<p>   So, in the face of finishing an overdue manuscript, this is how I found myself on the floor, digging through a box, this past Friday evening.</p>

<p>   The top layer of the box was filled mainly with brain-friendly items: objects of nominal significance that kept my brain on task. The task--as I'd defined it--was removing each object, staring at it blankly for a moment, then placing it in one of a growing number of piles in a semicircle around me. Ticket stubs and programs had their pile, scraps of paper carrying scribbled notes formed another pile. And so forth. What to do with these piles afterward was really of no concern at the time.</p>

<p>   Then the production hit an obstacle: Christie Klein. Or, rather, a soccer ball shift knob.</p>

<p>   The soccer ball shift knob is supposed to replace the ball atop your car's gear shift. Apparently the default ball is too painfully boring or too woefully devoid of personal expression for an appreciable section of the population. Thus, the production of the soccer ball shift knob.</p>

<p>   The soccer ball shift knob was still in its packaging.</p>

<p>   I held the prize and slouched, sighing a little. My brain did its work, derailed, and I was fifteen in Southern Ohio again, which is, for very understandable reasons, a really unpopular tourist destination in space-time.</p>

<p>   But this is when and where I knew Christie Klein.</p>

<p>   Christie Klein was average height for a girl of fifteen, with long brunette hair, the ends all perfectly straight. She wore a melting smile and, though she had only moved to our town, Grantswood, two years earlier, she had already become one of the most popular girls in our school. She rode horses and lived with her impossibly attractive parents on hilltop farmland outside of town. Their house was new and warm, and riding my bicycle up her long, ascending driveway always punctuated her family's affluence, and my family's lack. I would drop my bike in the grass a bit before reaching the house, embarrassed to stand it next to the maroon car I knew would be hers in a few months.</p>

<p>   Christie tanned easily and was often a gold-copper to my wilting peach. She and I could not have been more ill-suited for one another, dermatologically or otherwise, but I had asked her to the county fair, and she'd accepted. And in the few weeks between the invitation and its consummation, we became boyfriend and girlfriend, much to the under-the-breath disgust of the high school hierarchy.</p>

<p>   I had kissed a girl at that point, but only one, and even that was during a bonfire-side game of spin-the-bottle. I was Catholic, and scared, and brimming with lust. Christie Klein wore satin panties. And she only went to church at Christmas.</p>

<p>   Though her parents weren't often home, and even though, in the short period of time before the fair, we had ample opportunity and hormonal motive to do so, we did not have sex. We never got past awkwardly aborted nudity and nervous darts beneath underwear.</p>

<p>   On the day we were to attend the fair, Christie arrived at my house wearing a black and white sweater and her hair down. The sweater had an "A" in the upper right hand corner, and a "Z" in the lower left. Standing before her, our sexless sexual history was simultaneously omnipresent and completely erased. I was nervous to the point of nausea. She was effortlessly awe-inspiring in the way only a fifteen-year-old girl can be to a fifteen-year-old boy.</p>

<p>   Christie meeting me at my house was only for the sake of formality. She and her mother were essentially living at the fair in a trailer near the horse barns. Going to the fair with me, for her, was the equivalent of going to her living room, only with brighter lights and blaring big hair heavy metal.</p>

<p>   In the perfection of the Midwest autumn, the air around us and leaves beneath us were crisp and definite. Our hands pressed together, forming a pocket of warmth, as we went about all the requisite activities. Caramel apples. Perusing the pig barn. Perusing the rabbit barn. Def Leppard serenades on "the Gravitron." Attempting to win something for her at the machine gun game. Attempting to win something for her at the water gun game. Attempting to win something for her at skee-ball. Settling instead for miniature golf, where there were no prizes, just little holes and windmills. And later, some pizza.</p>

<p>   Finally there was the Ferris wheel. The Ferris wheel was the only ride of romance at the fair, and was populated by only two species: little girls with their fathers and young, sexually frustrated couples like us.</p>

<p>   We didn't talk much on the Ferris wheel. Her hand was on top of mine, mine on top of the cold metal bar in front of us. Eventually the ride slowed and began letting the current round of riders off. We had just missed being the first car unloaded and thus had the longest stint in the circular start-stop of disembarking.</p>

<p>   At the wheel's apex everything was slow and silent. The light of the fairgrounds pushed dully against the pure black coat of the country night, and we seemed to hang up there longer than one would expect. Christie's shoulder was warm against me. She looked at me out of the corner of her eye, then turned and kissed my cheek. It was the only thing beyond handholding we'd done that night, and all the more significant for it. Eventually, the wheel lurched, we began our descent, and after walking her back to her trailer by the horse barns, we said goodnight.</p>

<p>   I'm sure I didn't sleep well that night. Though I was boiling with the compulsion, I couldn't even masturbate, for fear it would somehow have bruised this new feeling. I fell asleep face down in the pillow, vocalizing two-person dialogue fantasies. Me and Christie. Me and my jealous friends. Me and God. Christie and her friends. Me and me.</p>

<p>   The entire week of the fair we had no school, and so I spent the next day lounging around the house, eating cake my mother had purchased at one of the baked goods auctions, and trying to keep my chest and head from exploding, and my hand from masturbating. Eventually I was given the relief of serving pork tenderloins.</p>

<p>   My mother, a municipal judge, was constantly campaigning and volunteering. The county fair was a gold mine of potential voters, and my sisters and I were smiling, animated trophies of her accomplishments as a mother. So this was how I got into the pork tenderloin serving business, which was fine by me, as dead pig and elderly farmers truly are the perfect antidotes for a rampant hard on.</p>

<p>   That evening Christie had to show horses. I could talk with her briefly before and after one of her events, but there was considerable dead time between, when she and her mother needed to prepare the horses and Christie's costumes. So chiefly I busied myself with attempting to right the failures of the night before: I set about trying to win Christie a prize.</p>

<p>   Nearly at the end of my admittedly meager fifteen-year-old's finances, fortune made peace with me at skee-ball. The police car lights above my alley whipped to life and sirens went off. I was puffing with pride and could feel confidence and adrenalin rushing out from my chest to my limbs. But I had to choose quickly! The barker-changemaster pointed to my area of selection. I had the choice between a stuffed diamond back rattlesnake and a soccer ball shift knob.</p>

<p>   So I reasoned this way:</p>

<p>   No girls I knew, Christie included, were fans of snakes in general, stuffed or otherwise, which made the already appealing soccer ball shift knob all the more clear as the correct choice. Christie would soon be getting her license and her promised car was a stick shift. The soccer tie-in seemed obvious and decently romantic, as we had kissed once, two weeks prior, on the soccer field behind our school building.</p>

<p>   (Again, I was at the beginning of a mental shift to being scatterbrained, or, as I was diagnosed some ten years after that fair, hypomanic, so somehow all this made complete sense. It did not occur to me for even an instant that these connections I was making would not occur immediately (perhaps ever) to a single other person on the face of the planet. It did not occur to me that this horrible, cheap piece of plastic and metal appeared dirty and shoddily painted (and perhaps even used?), all before being removed from its generic packaging. Or at least those things did not occur to me at that moment.)</p>

<p>   I took up my prize and walked, convinced, toward the main gates of the fairgrounds.</p>

<p>   On my way out, I noticed my friend, Jesse, and another boy, Harmon, involved in some low-grade dispute. Harmon was horribly obese and was perpetually ridiculed for this. This constant mockery - in concert with what I had learned peripherally was a poor home life - had crafted a rather nasty disposition. That is to say: Harmon was sort of an asshole. But I made it a point to leave him alone as I myself had been bullied on and off a few years earlier, and felt a sort of camaraderie with him and other outcasts.</p>

<p>   But still:</p>

<p>   I was fifteen and cocksure and nobody had beaten me up in years. And I had just won a prize for my girlfriend. And this guy was messing with my friend. So I walked into the situation.</p>

<p>   "Why don't you fuck off, man boobs?!" I said.</p>

<p>   Harmon was visibly wounded and surprised, as he'd never heard anything remotely like that from me. I can't say I was even sorry in the moment, I was just that filled with acidic teenage juices. Harmon muttered some malformed comeback and sulked off. I exchanged high fives with Jesse and continued toward the gate. </p>

<p>   "Hey!"</p>

<p>   I barely noticed it at first, it was just a spike in the noise field of the fair.</p>

<p>   "Hey!"</p>

<p>   I assumed this wasn't directed at me, not being followed by my name or some mutated version thereof. Horshmeer. Hornch. Pauly. Paula.</p>

<p>   "Hey!"</p>

<p>   I finally turned to see who was shouting. This was a mistake. A thick-necked boy and his identical twin moved toward me, followed by a beanstalk with a goatee. The thick-neck continued the lead with his slurring twang.</p>

<p>   "Hey, why're you messin' with that big kid?" It was immediately clear these three didn't know Harmon or Harmon's name.</p>

<p>   "He was shoving my friend," I responded. I hoped this would appease them.</p>

<p>   "He wuhddn' doin' nuthin'. He was just foolin' around."</p>

<p>   Nope. No dice. This guy just wanted to fight. God had put him on this earth to kick some ass.</p>

<p>   "Well… he was…"  I stammered. I didn't know where to go with this, so I figured I'd just go, "I'm just leaving, so…" I turned and started to walk away.</p>

<p>   A pair of hands grabbed me and whirled me around. It was the beanstalk. He held my arms to my side.</p>

<p>   The thick-necked talker was working himself into a frenzy "You wanna push somebody around? Huh? You wanna push somebody around?"</p>

<p>   Great. Now we'd gotten to saying things twice.</p>

<p>   He was shifting his weight back and forth from one foot to another. "Maybe you wanna push me around? Huh? You wanna push me around?"</p>

<p>   There were easily a hundred people watching at this point. A friend told me the next day he'd seen the whole thing hanging upside down in a nearby ride called "the Orbiter."</p>

<p>   I think I might have responded with something along the lines of no, really, I didn't want to push anyone around, but those sort of details didn't really matter. No, he was going to pummel me. I was going to be pummeled. We were locked in the inevitable. </p>

<p>   To the thick-neck's credit, he was a very skilled boxer. There was his hand next to his body, and then there was my head snapping back, again and again, with the beanstalk as a vice grip around me. There was only the occasional blur of his fist traveling, otherwise it was a well-executed, painful magic trick. He was just that good.</p>

<p>   Of course, that glowing evaluation of his pugilism came only afterward, as a way of masking the fact that it hurt, my lip was bloodied, and I was humiliated violently in front of more people than were in my entire graduating class. The thick-neck's girlfriend eventually pulled him away from me, screaming the fairly obvious fact that perhaps I didn't want to fight after all. I took the lull in action as my cue, turned, and shuffled out the gates.</p>

<p>   During the short walk home, I wiped the blood off, and on entering our kitchen said an abbreviated hello to my parents, keeping my head down. I went to my room and got in bed. I never told my parents what happened. I knew no one could fully understand. I had been sure of myself and been punished for it. This is the joy of being reared Catholic.</p>

<p>   In my twin bed, in that late Southern Ohio September, I thought of Christie.</p>

<p>   I still think of her from time to time.</p>

<p>   I remained infatuated with her long after she moved to Pennsylvania, the summer before our senior year. I visited her a few times: later, when she attended a college near mine in central Ohio. After college, she moved to Cincinnati, not far from my hometown, and became a real estate agent.</p>

<p>   We've exchanged a few e-mail updates, but there is ultimately no real point to this. We don't resemble those fifteen-year-olds. We were ill-fitted then, now she occupies an entirely different genus.</p>

<p>   I'm not even sure if she still rides horses. But I know I never gave her the shift knob. 
<br> 
<br>   And sitting here, in my current apartment, holding that cheap thing never given to its intended recipient, part of me wanted to throw it out, part of me wanted to call Christie. I have a trash can and her phone number, I could have done either.</p>

<p>   But then, faced with a real decision, my mind did its job, flipped a silent switch, and I turned to something else, throwing my careful semicircle of piles back into the box, moving the door back into place as I left the room. </p>
