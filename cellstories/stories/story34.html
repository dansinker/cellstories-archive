<h2>George and the Crocodile Loafers</h2>
	<h3>Jesse Raub</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>As the door of the bodega he worked at was pushed open, the first thing Jerrod saw was the butterscotch pointed toe of George’s right shoe as it came down slow, like a ballerina pointing, onto the flecked linoleum floor.  As George slid into the store wearing baggy jeans and an oversized black t-shirt, he did a half tap dance past a row of pork rinds and a revolving stand of potato chips.  He strolled up counter, tapped his fingers on the Plexiglas that covered a set of example lottery tickets, and smiled.</p>

<p>"So?" George asked with a smile.  The white of his teeth was offset by his skin—rich, smooth and the same color as his new butterscotch loafers.</p>

<p>"So what?” Jerrod replied.</p>

<p>"Crocodile, pendejo!” George yelled back at him.</p>

<p>"Man you sound retarded when you try and speak Spanish,” Jerrod said, shaking his head and wiping the counter down with a damp rag.</p>

<p>George could have killed him. He first saw the loafers propped up in the window of the men’s store down the block when he was walking home from the community college he was taking a Spanish course at. At twenty-one, still living in his parent’s basement, and as a fourth generation immigrant from Pureto Rico, George had a hard time coming to grasp with his heritage and the community of street culture at large in his neighborhood. His family didn’t speak Spanish.  His dad was actually some white guy from Tuscaloosa who played folk songs in dive bars for extra cash, and his mom said it was disrespectful to use a language in the house that his father couldn’t understand. But the shoes. There they were. </p>

<p>The crocodile scales were layered like ancient armor in neat rows with a slight overlap on each one. The toes were slim and pointed, almost like a pair of hobnail boots. The color was so rich and tan that George felt like he could pour it over ice cream and eat it. Tan crocodile loafers.  Shoes for a man.  A man who knows his heritage.  He spent weeks giving extra piano lessons to people in the neighborhood, picked up an extra shift at the warehouse he did overnight stock for, and paid layaway for four months. Slipping the shoes on for the first time, as he sat on his bed in his dark basement bedroom, felt like he all at once reached a hand out and touched the hand of God, became a man, and reconciled with his ancestors angry at him for losing his culture. </p>

<p>"You know what?” Jerrod said, laughing. “You look like you’re about to open up for Steve Harvey.  You got yourself some rich black man shoes on, there.” </p>

<p>George’s face dropped. His ears sagged. His buzzed short and gelled hair seemed to flatten. He stood, dumb and deaf, in front of the counter with a worn frown on his face. Dortch, a guy they both went to high school with, sidled up next to them. </p>

<p> "Them some nice shoes,” Dortch said, gesturing with the white, Styrofoam slushie cup he held in his hand at George’s tan crocodile loafers.</p>

<p>"See?” Jerrod said.  “Black man shoes.”</p>

<p>“Aw, what the hell that’s supposed to mean?” Dortch said throwing his arms open in dismay.</p>

<p>George watched in slow motion as a nuclear green drop of the slushie jumped the side of Dortch’s cup and flew silently through the air, twisting and stretching, morphing like a blob in a heavenly arc until it landed squarely on the left toe of George’s left loafer.</p>

<p>"Chingate, cabron!” George screamed at Dortch.</p>

<p>He stormed out of the store, shoving the push door as hard as he could. The bells jingled, then subsided as the door’s hydraulic arm slowly settled it back into place.</p>

<p>“The fuck he just say?” Dortch asked Jerrod.</p>

<p>George stomped down the street, his eyes darting from side to side. He started jogging, then broke out into a full out sprint.  His mom’s house was a few blocks away, and under the mattress in his bedroom, sitting on top of the bed frame, was a pellet gun that looked convincingly like carbon-black, nine-millimeter handgun. He stuffed it down the front of his jeans, so that the handle still stuck out menacingly enough.  He’d show both of those fuckers. </p>

<p>When he pushed open the door to the bodega again, Jerrod and Dortch both had their hands raised in the air with wide, scared eyes. Dortch’s green slushie was leaking out of his overturned cup on the floor, pooling around his white sneakers.</p>

<p>“What the...” George said, before a small man with a nylon over his head jumped out from between two aisles and pointed his pistol at George.</p>

<p>He looked down, saw the pistol butt sticking out from George’s waistband, and pointed the gun at George’s thigh.</p>

<p>“No, no wait!” George shouted before the man pulled the trigger and shot George in the leg.</p>

<p>The gunfire rang out in everyone’s ears.</p>

<p>“Ah, shit!” George screamed as he dropped to the linoleum floor.</p>

<p>He held his left leg in the air, a vicious burning and stinging sensation ripping through his thigh muscles. Blood began to trickle out of the bullet wound, and started sliding down his leg until a few drops fell onto his right shoe.</p>

<p>“You asshole!” George shouted at the man with the gun, who was standing there, frozen.</p>

<p>Then his arm started lowering itself again, this time aimed at George’s chest as George tried sitting up. Acting on instinct only, he whipped his pellet gun out of his waistband, and threw it as hard as he could at the gunman.  It went wild and struck Dortch in the nose with a splat.</p>

<p>“Ow, God!” Dortch screamed, throwing his hands up to his face.</p>

<p>The gunman turned, and it was all Jerrod needed.</p>

<p>As one of the only white kids in the neighborhood, Jerrod usually got shit from people he didn’t know, or people from a different part of town.  What they didn’t understand was that Jerrod was crazy, and there was a reason he still worked at the bodega even though he had been held up twice before. </p>

<p>Jerrod snatched the aluminum baseball bat he kept tilted up against the wall by his leg  and raised it above his head as he dove head first over the counter and into the gunman.  He caught the gunman in mid-turn, knocking him to the ground before scrambling up to his feet again, kicking the gun away with his left leg while raising the baseball bat and bringing it down hard against the gunman’s back.</p>

<p>“You motherfucker!” Jerrod yelled.</p>

<p>The gunman cried out as the bat man a hard slapping noise against his spine.</p>

<p>“You don’t bring that trash into my house!” he called out.</p>

<p>Jerrod circled around the gunman, then hopped and kicked him in the face. The gunman’s neck recoiled, and snapped back.  Jerrod leaned down and whipped off the nylon that was obscurring his face. It was nobody that they knew, but then again, his nose was broken almost sideways and was bleeding, and his eyes were rolled back into his head.</p>

<p>When the paramedics arrived, they assured Jerrod that he hadn’t killed the man, just knocked him unconscious. Dortch was treated on site—nothing was broken. The gunman and George were both wheeled away on separate gurneys and loaded into the back of two ambulances. The EMTs had tied a large bandage around George’s bullet wound, but were fairly certain the bullet had missed the artery.</p>

<p>As the ambulance started up, and the lights flashed on and the siren sounded, George looked over at the trim, young black paramedic who was sitting next to his gurney in the back of the truck.  The paramedic pointed down to George’s shoes.</p>

<p>“Shame,” he said, pointing to the red blood stain and green slushie stain on George’s crocodile loafers. “Those look like a nice pair of shoes.” </p>
