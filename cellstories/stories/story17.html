<h2>Darkness, then Light</h2>
	<h3>Deb R. Lewis</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>I said up front, before Mollie was even born, that I wasn’t parent material.  Were it not for love, I’d be a complete social recluse living in a nest of books and paper, talking to characters--the only kind of people I can make vanish when they get annoying.  Love, though, has other plans. </p>

<p>When Mollie was born, I figured she was a goner.  No prenatal care, bombarded with crystal meth in utero.  Born six weeks early and septic--meaning bacteria made a home in her bloodstream.  Five pounds--lost ounces with each day. Yeah, I thought, better luck in the next life. </p>

<p>But she lived.   </p>

<p>Really I ought to have known:  she’d already beat an abortion appointment.  Her mother thought she was only a few weeks along--turns out it was more like six months. </p>

<p><h4>***</h4> </p><p>My wife, Gail, and I are taking Mollie’s older half-sibs, Gail's daughter's kids--Gail’s blonde, sun-kissed, blue-eyed grandkids--each summer, from school’s out to the first fall bell.  Give the grandkids ten weeks’ break from their psycho divorcing parents.  Each June we're coercing Morgan back into being a kid again--swear she was born with worried eyes, wrangling down Leah’s manipulative streak--being the middle kid seemed to make her nuts, and teaching little Lukie how to talk all over again.  And not to hit.  Which takes longer each year until finally it's the second week of August before he shows any self-restraint--take him back, it starts over. </p>

<p><h4>***</h4> </p><p>Then Mollie was born to Gail's daughter in the cool, darkening season of 2002.  Instantly diagnosed failure-to-thrive. The mother’s milk dried up, on top of Mollie being sick. Each time we went to look in, I refused to hold this baby, not wanting to get attached.  Better luck in the next life. Anyone with sense could read the situation and know Mollie was a goner. Like I said, she lived--maybe she’s meant to be here. </p>

<p>We found out when “Mother” crashed out in 20-hour post-crank comas, while Morgan and Leah were at school, it was four-year-old Luke pulling bottled formula from the fridge to feed his baby sister.  Ain’t many babies who like cold feedings, but I guess it was better than nothing.</p>

<p><h4>***</h4> </p><p>Summer 2003. Morgan’s 11, Leah’s 9, Luke’s 4. Mollie’s about 6 months. I pick up the older kids at the end of May. While I wait for Morgan to finish packing her brother, their ma comes stumbling through with sleep-squashed eyes, looking for a bottle for Mollie. She fishes one from under the sofa, opens it, sniffs it, makes a face, dumps it in the kitchen sink, gives it a rinse or two, then pours in some off-brand version of Yoo-hoo and feeds that to Mollie. </p>

<p>Now, I like Yoo-hoo. But it ain’t a substitute for baby formula. </p>

<p>I don't say anything, because Mollie's staying put.  We got the big kids set up with day camp in the Park District, so I can teach a summer class. But the Park district won't take babies. So five, six weeks from now I got to return for Mollie, and I don't want the kids' ma to give me or Gail a royal rash about whether we can let any of the kids visit at all.  You know, she'd do that.  She's threatened it before. </p>

<p><h4>***</h4> </p><p>When my professor gig ends in July, I return for Mollie because now I’ll be home with her. </p>

<p>Sad baby. I had to wake her during feedings or she wouldn’t eat. She never got chubby, but looked stronger, had a little better color--pale porcelain instead of bluish translucence.   </p>

<p>She howled at bath times, afraid--I don’t think she’d ever had a bath before. I showed her how to smack the water. “Splash, splash, splash,” I’d say.  Sad little eyes watching me. In steps we got there, her tiny hand smacking the water. She got to like bathing. </p>

<p>Summers end, though, and I had to take the kids back for their dose of the Hoosier public school system. Mollie’d go home too. I didn’t feel good about taking the big kids back, but at least they were a unit--I knew they’d watch out for each other. </p>

<p>For example, before Mollie, before all this, after not being able to raise the mother on the phone once, we--my partner Gail and I--busted springs for Terre Haute. The parents’ separation had turned nasty. Midnight, we arrived at the weedy yard, the disintegrating trailer. The mother was out.  In her stead, some man, mid-thirties with limp black hair, and a punk boy of no resemblance.   </p>

<p>The man held the screen door latch. Didn’t want to let us in. </p>

<p>Gail put her hands on her hips, glasses blazing in the dark. “Well, I’m the children’s grandmother, and I want to see the kids. Try and stop me; I’ll call the goddamn fuzz.”    </p>

<p>The screen door drifted open.  </p>

<p>Gail boogied down the hall, to the kids’ room--they slept together like hamsters. She tripped over a bedroll in the doorway. Morgan, it turned out, wrapped up like a tamale. She was 8 or 9 at the time. Leah was asleep under the bed with Lukie.  While Gail squatted between the piles of laundry lining the hall, I stood ignored, scanning the junked living room, and heard her ask, “Morgan, honey, why are you sleeping in the door?” </p>

<p>Most times, Morgan wakes hard but roused easily this night.  “I’m protecting them.” </p>

<p>“What do you mean, honey?” </p>

<p>But Morgan wouldn’t, couldn’t say.</p>

<p>“Well, wake up, sweetie,” Gail said, “Get your brother and sister.  You’re coming to our motel--maybe you can swim tomorrow!” </p>

<p>“We don’t have swimsuits.”  That was Morgan, ever practical. </p>

<p>“We’ll go to Wal-mart and get you some,” Gail said.  Every time we went down, the kids needed something and we’d go to Wally World, get them clothes, then write their names on the tags so their mother couldn’t return it all for drug money. </p>

<p><h4>***</h4> </p><p>When I dropped the kids off at the end of Summer 2003, it didn’t feel right. But Gail wasn’t with me--had to work--and I am legally nothing to these kids. Children in Indiana--in this whole country, actually--are considered legal property. I didn’t want to leave them, Mollie least of all.  I’d been reluctant to care, and my hardened stance--the automatic consignment to death--became a very realistic fear. As I drove from Terre Haute to Covington, I had to pull over and call Gail at work to get my head back on. I remember sobbing into the phone: “It’s the worst thing I’ve ever done. It’s not right.  It’s not right.  Leaving that baby there. It’s not right...” </p>

<p><h4>***</h4> </p><p>Way it eventually goes down is:  Two weeks after I’ve dropped the kids off, we get this phone call. The mother’s going to jail tomorrow for manufacture and possession of crystal meth.  The older kids are with their dad, but no one knows who Mollie's father is and so we’ve got twelve hours to fetch the baby or she’s going into state foster care. Like that’s even a choice. </p>

<p>We book across the state line, meet at a motel. I ain’t blood; I got no voice. While Gail and kin work out the devilish details, I take care of the baby.  See, Mollie is nine months old at this point and can’t even roll herself over. Her blue eyes are too sad for a baby’s face and her head sits like a pumpkin on body of sticks. </p>

<p>I peel her from the filthy car seat--where she’s apparently stored at least twenty hours a day--to change her, but her little bottom is caked with feces, broken and bloody from her waist to her knees. I want to kill the bitch in the next room with my bare hands, but run a bath instead. Our bath-time games from the summer are completely lost to fear; Mollie shrieks in the water. </p>

<p>“Heeey,” I coax, patting the water.  “Look, Mollie--splash!” </p>

<p>Eventually we’ll rescue bath time from the land of dread and terror--again--so that the bathtub becomes a favorite place. Right now, though, her eyes watch my hands. She will not meet my gaze.  You ever encounter a baby who won’t look anyone in the face? There’s nothing creepier. Nothing sadder. I feel both disowned and accused. By the time we’re done, the water drains black. </p>

<p>The scent of Desetin tickles at an edge of memory that predates words. I slather it on thick to unknot my chest as much as to soothe her angry skin. </p>

<p>And damn it, I don’t want this. This kid needs us, needs me. I’m not fucking parent material. I don’t have patience for anyone or anything that interferes with my absorption in stories, my reading, my writing. Son-of-a-bitch, though, this kid needs us. </p>

<p>So the mother lands in jail. Her story’s tangled; not even court transcripts offer the real truth. And we're not overly thrilled that the big kids are with their dad, but at least he'll feed them, clean them once in a while, and make sure they get to school each day.  They don't visit in summer any more--in fact, we almost never get to see or even speak with them, but least they're physically safe. </p>

<p><h4>***</h4> </p><p>Mollie’s six now. Gail’s her legal guardian, her biological grandmother, and her Mimi. Me? I fill in the gaps. </p>

<p>What’s the word for me? I’m like a dyke father or something. </p>

<p>Gail’s mother? Even the postman calls her Nana; Gail’s Mimi to the kids; so there’s room for creative license, but we don’t know what to have Mollie call me. For a while, she calls me “Mama”--feels like I’m committing fraud every time I answer to it. She calls me “Da” and I think she’s trying to say, “Deb” but then it becomes “Dada.”  Yeah--that made me strut. Then she changes to “Mama Deb” then “Mimi Deb” and I tell Gail I’ll just answer to whatever she calls me. Out of the mouths of babes, and all that.  Eventually, she settles on “my Mimi and my Deb.”   </p>

<p><h4>***</h4> </p><p>Those aren’t her first words though. Moll didn’t start with the classic “mama” and “dada.” Why would she?   </p>

<p>We were driving down Lake Shore Drive during the winter splendors--when tiny lights brave the darkness so we can too. Gail and I kept pointing them out. “Look, Mollie, look at the pretty lights.”  They fascinated her. It was that spark of curiosity that made me think she’d be all right, you know?  That she wasn’t and would never again be a goner. </p>

<p>This night we were tired, not saying much of anything. And there in the quiet, she says it.  It comes out “Lies. Lies. Peet-it lies.” Her first words are “lights, pretty lights.” A couple weeks after that came “thank you.”   </p>

<p>Beauty and gratitude, folks. Not a bad start.</p>
