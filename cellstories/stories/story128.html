<h2>Eduardo</h2>

		</p><p>“Eduardo,” he said again, and I watched the tip of his tongue dart against the back of his teeth. We were sitting at El Tren, a bar near the Bilbao Metro stop in Madrid, and Eduardo was coaching my pronunciation. I tried to emulate the sultry way he spoke, the way the words rolled like red wine around his mouth, but it still came out flat. “Eduardo.” </p>

<p>“Eeeeeedddduuuuu uuuuaaaaaaaaaarr rrrrrrrddddddddd ddooooooooo,” he said. “Eduardo,” I said. He grinned and sipped his Estrella. “Almost,” he said, affectionately rubbing my leg. I smiled back and my heart—no, my entire body—skipped a beat.  </p>

<p>I met Eduardo online, but not in a match.com kind of way. I was 24 years old, teaching English in Madrid for a year, and in order to become fluent in Spanish, I decided to get an intercambio, this exchange where an English speaker and a Spanish speaker meet and just chat, half in Spanish, half in English. All my American friends had one and they were far ahead of me with their Spanish skills, so I scoped out craigslist Madrid for an intercambio. </p>

<p>“Wanted, American or other for Intercambio. Must be fun. And like to drink.” </p>

<p>I responded, and two nights later I was sitting at El Tren with Eduardo, a 25 year-old computer programmer. And god, he was hot. Like a 25 year-old Brawny man with a better smile. His English was pretty good, not that I was paying attention. After all, we were really speaking the international language, not yet love but the international language of chemistry.  </p>

<p>The chemistry was evident even before we MET, you guys, in one of those totally unexplainable moments—see, I was several blocks from El Tren, when I totally and shamelessly started scoping out this dude walking towards me. He was tall, with a George Clooney-type build, brown hair, a beard and a confident stride that was intoxicatingly hot. We were about to pass each other and suddenly our eyes became like, unbendingly transfixed. Neither of us blinked as, underneath a streetlight, we came face to face and the world stopped—LITERALLY, you guys, it STOPPED. </p>

<p>“Molly?” He asked, leaning his head in inquisitively.  </p>

<p>“Eduardo?” were standing a foot away from each other, and the streetlight above made him glow.  
<br>This was it. I knew it. The moment where the world stops, there’s an instant connection, and this certainty in your heart that your life is about to change. How else do you explain the magic? The fact that he knew who I was though we’d never met, the fact that we just couldn’t stop STARING at each other? The moment settled and we just smiled, shook hands, and he led me to the bar. I know! Weird,right? </p>

<p>At the end of the date, he led me to my apartment. </p>

<p>“Hasta luego mi Corazon.” He said it so quickly I only heard “mi.” </p>

<p>“Um, what?” </p>

<p>“Hasta luego mi corazon,” he said, slower. “You try.” </p>

<p>“Hasta luego mi Corazon,” I repeated, sounding super American. “What’s that?” </p>

<p>“See you later my heart. It is, how do you say, a word of affection.”  </p>

<p>After our first official date (a trip to a tapas bar), our first official kiss (while watching the Spanish version of “Mallrats”) and our first official sex (at his house, shortly after the Spanish version of “Mallrats), we were officially a couple. And I was blissful. He was strong and powerful, and manly, and hot. Really hot. He made me laugh and he was spontaneous and energetic and outgoing, all in all, the perfect Spanish boyfriend, someone I could care about but still avoid emotional destruction when I had to leave. It was ideal. </p>

<p>Eduardo was the perfect tour guide. Not only did I live an authentic Spanish life with him—Flamenco, tapas, siestas, all-night clubbing, making out in parks—but Eduardo’s pride for his country was palpable, contagious,100 times stronger than anyone else I met in Spain… His chest puffed out when he spoke of anything related to his country, whether it was Spanish beer, Spanish wine, Spanish food, Spanish architecture, Spanish music—even like, Spanish trees or the seats on the Madrid subway.  He would boast, “is the best.” </p>

<p>“Preciosa,” he said to me, leaning over a café con leche at an outdoor café. This was his nickname for me, and when he said it I wanted to simultaneously pass out and do a cartwheel. We were sitting at a sidewalk café in a crowded plaza, our chairs pulled right next to each other. It was hot out, and Eduardo was shirtless. His half-nudity hadn’t bothered me on the way to the cafe, but the fact that his t-shirt still hung out of his back pocket, though there was food present, made me cringe. I tried not to notice that no one else in the plaza was shirtless. He leaned back, stretching his arms over his head, indicating the surrounding plaza. </p>

<p>“Isn’t this the best? Spain is the best.” I tried to ignore the sweat-clumped armpit hair.  
<br>“I love Spain too, Eduardo. But the music scene in America is awesome. There are all these killer up and coming bands, and---“ </p>

<p>Eduardo shrugged. “Maybe. But we are still the best.” He sounds like a dick, right? That was just him, the epitome of Spanish machismo—proud, boastful, always right, slightly misogynistic. I didn’t flinch. His confident persona was part of what attracted me to him, and, well, I’d be leaving Spain eventually anyway, right? I figured Spanish men were just like that. Although the more Spaniards I knew, it was obvious Eduardo’s behavior was far from the norm. But I was too wrapped up in a haze of love to even care. </p>

<p>Our relationship progressed for six months, and then, August came. I was headed back to the states at the end of the month and while I was having a blast with Eduardo, I was homesick to get back to family, friends, and Minneapolis, to pick up life where I’d left off. Via copious amounts of journaling and conversations with girlfriends over bottles of wine, I was emotionally ready to leave my Spanish love.  </p>

<p>A week before my departure, Eduardo and I were sitting on the deck outside his bedroom, savoring the sunshine and watching the streets below. I was on his lap and he rubbed his hands up and down my legs. </p>

<p>“Preciosa,” he said, his breath on my neck. “Pienso que me voy a las Estados Unidos tambien.” I swiveled around to face him, straddling his legs.  
<br>Um, he was going to come to the states too? </p>

<p>“I found a landscape job in Minneapolis. I think maybe I come with you.” </p>

<p>It was supposed to be every girl’s dream: if I read it in a Danielle Steel novel or saw it on a Lifetime movie, I would swoon. Spanish lover decides to abandon his life and follow his American girlfriend across the ocean where he would bring his Spanish hotness to the States and they would share this beautiful bilingual love and live happily ever after. </p>

<p>But I wasn’t swooning, or even smiling. I froze. I was ready to say goodbye, to move on and now… he would be there too?  </p>

<p>“You would do that?” I asked. </p>

<p>He shrugged. “I think, why not? For a few months, maybe.” I kissed him passionately, because that’s what the Lifetime character would do, right? And by kissing him, I got to ignore the pit that was starting to spread slowly, like an oil spill, in my stomach. </p>

<p>For the first week of his trip, everything was awesome. He subletted a studio apartment in Linden Hills from my high school friend Ryan who was living in Japan, and I loved showing him my city, even though he always pointed out that things were better in Spain. </p>

<p>However, it soon became clear that Eduardo, um, didn’t exactly translate. It was a Labor Day BBQ at my parents house with nearly thirty friends and family. The entire crew was gathered outside the front door to say goodbye, hugging and giving kisses on the cheek in small clusters, when suddenly Eduardo charged through the crowd, taking these big, long, deliberate strides, bumping into people on his way to me, where he grabbed the back of my head and started kissing, a tonguey, slobbery, can’t come up for air kiss.  </p>

<p>My body was paralyzed with anxiety as, even while he licked around my mouth, I was aware of the crowd around us. He finally came up for air. </p>

<p>“That is how we say goodbye in Spain,” he said. He looked jubilant, but no one laughed. My grandma’s eyebrows were nearly in her hairline and my neighbor’s jaw was on the ground. My face was on fire as I tried to joke with my family, “yup! They do things differently over there!” “Yeah, Spain sure is different.” But I was dying. I mean, we’re not really that comfortable with PDA in the states and definitely not in the Midwest and DEFINITELY not in Minnesota. The crowd awkwardly resumed goodbyes. I glanced over at Eduardo and saw that he softly bit his lower lip, and shifted his weight nervously. He was uncomfortable. In Spain, I’d never seen him anything but confident, and the shattering of his façade was alarming. I couldn’t be mad at him, right? He was in a different country, trying to learn his way around the culture and customs. I forced myself to be understanding, to be sensitive, to help him find the blend between being himself and American etiquette. </p>

<p>But over the next few weeks, the cringe-worthy moments began to stack so quickly, my ability to be understanding couldn’t keep up. He adopted a uniform of no shirt and cutoffs- short cutoffs, like Tobias from Arrested Development- even though I warned him several times that it wasn’t okay to eat in restaurants without a shirt in America and that cutoffs were considered gross. His hygiene became an afterthought, he vulgarly spoke in Spanish in front of people who he knew couldn’t speak the language, he was rude to people, called every American a “puta Americano”—a fucking American— and he refused to listen when I tried to explain certain American customs.  </p>

<p>“Eduardo, you have to tip at least 15% here. That’s how it works.” I said time and time again at bars and restaurants. “I do not have to,” he would say slyly. “I am a foreigner.” After a month, I stopped excusing everything. The machismo and bravado and shirtlessness weren’t his Spanish quirks, things I could excuse because of his culture or language barriers. Turns out that without the cushion of Madrid between us, he was just kind of an asshole. </p>

<p>Our relationship soon went south at a breakneck pace. I was trapped—he came here for me and now, I was stuck, which was definitely not supposed to happen in the Lifetime movie. We spent less time together and bickered when we did meet up. Even the sex, which was once pretty great, had deteriorated so far that on our last time he was on, in, off and done, asleep in the fetal position in two minutes flat. </p>

<p>After our untranslatable romance hit the skids, I went to his house to break it off. When I got there, he was sitting on the stoop, waiting for me. “Do you think we can talk?” He asked. I sat down next to him on the concrete steps. In front of his house, runners and bikers sped by. </p>

<p>“Is a beautiful day,” he said. </p>

<p>“Eduardo,” I started.  </p>

<p>“Bale. Un momento, por favor, Molly.” He was leaning back onto his hands, and sat up suddenly. He hadn’t shaved in weeks and his beard was scruffy and unkempt. “Escucha me, bale?” I nodded and Eduardo began to talk. In Spanish. Fast. He was like a fountain of words, spilling forth thought upon thought, all in his native language. </p>

<p>“English Eduardo, Please speak English. I can’t understand you.” But he kept talking, occasionally stroking his beard, his face remaining casual despite the urgency of his words. I listened intently for familiar words and phrases—he was uncomfortable? He was not at home? I heard the same phrase over and over: “eres la unica personal, la unica persona” you are the only person, the only person, until one sentence seemed to pop forth: “You are the only person who understands me.” </p>

<p>My heart MELTED. Here was this man, in a foreign country, knowing only me, uncomfortable in his own skin, with barely another person who could understand his language, let alone understand who he really was. The excess bravado and machismo were just defense mechanisms. No one here understood him, and in return, he clung harder to himself—or who he believed himself to be—that ever before. </p>

<p>“Eduardo,” I said. I scooted towards him, placed my hand upon his, feeling his skin underneath my palm. “I do. I do understand you.”  </p>

<p>His eyes lit up, and in his spontaneous way he scooped me up into his arms and carried me inside. I didn’t fight it, just went along as he carried me through the hall and towards his room. I couldn’t break up with him now, could I? Or maybe… I remembered the difficulty of feeling utterly out of place my first few months in Spain, and I knew exactly how he felt. Was I being too hard on him? </p>

<p>He nudged the door to his room open and instantly, I pushed myself out of his arms. The apartment was covered in wrinkled clothing, papers, empty fast food wrappers, and comic books—strewn across the bed, crumpled under the desk chair, tossed lamely into the hamper, scattered across the floor. There was a massive black stain on the bedspread, and multiple stains across the carpet. I stared in horror. Ryan, the guy Eduardo was subletting from was a NEAT FREAK, the kind of guy who made his bed with hospital corners every morning, hung his clothing in his closet by color and stored his comics in plastic under his bed. After one month, Eduardo had destroyed apartment and almost everything in it. I looked at him and noticed for the first time that he was wearing Ryan’s Apple Valley High School cross country t-shirt, and he’d torn the sleeves off. </p>

<p>“Oh my GOD, Eduardo!” I sputtered. </p>

<p>“Ah, is okay. Is not that bad. I pay rent, I can do what I want.” </p>

<p>“No, no, you don’t get it…” I couldn’t speak. I just stared up at him in shock.  </p>

<p>He smiled and playfully punched my shoulder. “Puta Americana,” he said, trying to joke with me. His mouth was smiling, but his eyes showed no laugh lines. “You so much care what other people think.” He said it again, “puta Americana.” </p>

<p>“Puta Americana?” I repeated. “Just because you don’t care what ANYBODY thinks…” But it wasn’t worth the effort. It wasn’t a language barrier—Eduardo didn’t understand ME. There was no need to translate anything anymore.  </p>
