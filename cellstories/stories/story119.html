<h2>De-Hyst</h2>

	<p>
		</p><p>My true love, Gail, has been a nurse since God made dirt.  Nurses generally regard doctors as a class of over-privileged idiots, so when she said she’d found us a new gynecologist, I figured he must be one hell of a coochie-man. </p>

<p>We made our first appointment together.  First thing, we make sure he knows we’re a pair of dykes.  Our health concerns are slightly different, for instance: we don’t know or care about the date of our last period. </p>

<p>Dr. Kafka’s buzzcut shines red under the office light.  He’s a meaty, youngish man with handsome and, so far, unsurprised brown eyes.  “Anything else?” he asks. </p>

<p>I glance at Gail.  She nods. I blurt: “We’re leatherdykes.”  </p>

<p>“Really?” Suddenly, he has dimples. </p>

<p>“Don’t worry, doctor.” Gail pets my head to see what he’s made of. “I don’t like to break my favorite toys.” He and I blush together, and I suspect he has his own frame of reference for the SM thing. We decide we’ll keep him. </p>

<p>So, first exam with my brand spanking new gynecologist, he asks, “How long have you had that moustache?”  Since the eighth grade, I tell him.  Then he says that the dyke miracle I’ve accomplished of three periods a year must end.  Get this, puts me on birth control.  Says I got to bleed every month.   </p>

<p>Now, guys, I know, you like to hear about periods the way my mother appreciates a great fart joke.  But, come on, how'd you feel in my shoes?  </p>

<p>So he fiddles with my hormones.  I tell him that it’s one thing to have a period every month.  It’s quite another to be on the rag 6 months solid.  He fiddles some more—until, finally, I sit on the edge of the gyne table and cry an anemic fit of tears.  I tell him: </p>

<p><ol>
<br><li>That if anything bigger comes sliding out of my hoo-hoo, I’m going to declare it on my taxes and put him down as the father.
<br></li><li> That if he can’t fix it, I will fix it myself, because:
<br></li><li>They ain’t nothing wrong with me that four bottles of Moscato, a sharp knife, and a roll of duct tape can’t fix.
<br></li></ol></p>

<p>That if anything bigger comes sliding out of my hoo-hoo, I’m going to declare it on my taxes and put him down as the father.</p>

<p>That if he can’t fix it, I will fix it myself, because:</p>

<p>They ain’t nothing wrong with me that four bottles of Moscato, a sharp knife, and a roll of duct tape can’t fix.
<br> 
<br>Oh, but I meant it.  He declares a hysterectomy our final option and, "Is August 7th OK?"   </p>

<p>I start telling our SM friends that Gail is having me spayed for bad behavior.  </p>

<p>Now you would think abdominal surgery implies a certain amount of delicacy and precision.  But no, after I’m under, Dr. K and his chorus line of residents—think: Pirates of Penzance—stood me up—I’ll swear to this in court because I know how my body felt afterwards—they stood me up and shot out  my uterus with a cannon.  I emerged from anesthesia begging them to help me curl around the cannonball, just so I could die in peace. </p>

<p>A night on observation and I go home the next day, floating on Norco. </p>

<p>Fast forward.  Ten days later, I’ve abstained from Norco, so my low grade temp will register and now I lay, slightly feverish, on the gyne table, legs supported by a sliding extension instead of the beloved stirrups.  Now pay attention, this next magic trick takes place in an ordinary doctor’s office.   </p>

<p>I watch Dr. Kafka’s face, because when I’m lying back I can’t see over my tits or my gut.  (It’s not as glorious as it sounds.)  Now the earlier duct tape bit sounded far-fetched, but below my navel and just above the Venus V, there's an immense second mouth with its lips turned in behind a line of steri-strips—which is basically sterile strapping tape—holding the incision mum, a perverted jack o’lantern grin rendered in belly-flesh as purple as an eggplant. </p>

<p>He presses. There’s pressure but no pain.  The left side of this mouth drools blackish blood.  He wipes and presses again: raspberry tar.  Having the gynecologist’s gift, he’s been chatting about anything except what’s happening but now he quits jabbering about Three Floyds beer, looks me in the eye, and says, “You have a hematoma—a big blood clot.  We have to open this up.  Clean it out.” </p>

<p>I nod without quite registering the meaning of the word open. </p>

<p>“Now, this isn’t dangerous,” he says, “It’ll have to heal open, but it’s not dangerous.  Really, it’s just a drag.” He meets eyes with me to see if I register.  “Let me get some supplies and an assistant.”  He leaves partly because he wants it to have time to sink in. </p>

<p>He totes in flat, paper packages of gauze squares and blue plastic sheets, absorbent on one side.  His assistant enters.  She gloves up. </p>

<p>“Gail here?” Dr. K asks, casual as can be. </p>

<p>“She’s coming from work. Be here any time now.” </p>

<p>So he peels off the tape and pries my second mouth open with a gloved hand.  He slices the stubborn sealed, healed sections with a scalpel, which must be sharp, because I scarcely feel it. </p>

<p>He pauses.  “How you doing?” </p>

<p>I’m disembodied at this point, floating near the ceiling.  “Hanging out,” I say.  But then I look and he’s addressing his assistant.  Marla looks clammy pale.  See, there are nurses that can hold a beating heart in their hands if they have to.  This wasn’t that kind of nurse.  This was the kind who touches surgical wounds the way fake Lesbos touch each other in a porno flick.   </p>

<p>“It’s warm in here,” she says, trying to pony up. </p>

<p>Dr. K tells to go sit down.  She brisks out the door—it’s just him & me—and that’s when it dusks upon me that this thing happening? this here-and-now? is unusual. </p>

<p>By now he has the blue plasticized sheet spread over my legs and he pulls out the clot with his hands.  I feel this numb and distant tugging.  The nerve endings haven’t mended from surgery and, while this is a good thing, everything feels twenty feet away.  Handful after handful of dense, wet clot that I cannot see—I feel the warm weight of it against my thighs.   </p>

<p>“Messy, messy,” he says to himself.  (Yeah, you should’ve been there.) </p>

<p>He goes through gauze sponges like they’re multiplying and he wants an excuse to get rid of them.  Then he addresses me, “Well, kid, you SM dykes are tough.”  And I grin—the only thing a pig bottom enjoys more than endorphins is recognition of her gluttonous endurance. </p>

<p>“Seriously,” he says, “not just anyone will let you cut them open without anesthetic—you don’t want to see it, do you?” His dimples tell me he’s asked because he knows the answer. </p>

<p>“I am morbidly curious,” I say.  I want to know what’s happened to me. </p>

<p>He shows me a single largish chunk of soft-set lava rock.  It’s not the only one—not even the biggest—but it takes two hands to keep it from breaking and falling to the floor like an over-baked raspberry-chocolate custard.  He bundles up this miracle I’ve made and throws it in the biohazard trash, then peels off his latex gloves.  “I need to see if your nurse is here and I need to check on mine.  You wait here.”  </p>

<p>I’m lying wide open—where on earth does he think I’d go? </p>

<p>While he’s gone, Marla and another nurse poke their faces in, but will not step off the hallway carpet.  They talk to the wound in my belly.  “Where is he?” Marla asks. </p>

<p>“Went to check on you and get Gail.” </p>

<p>They back from the room and close the door.   </p>

<p>Later Gail will tell me that Marla was lying, pale, on the floor when Dr. K snagged her off the elevator and rushed her in the back way.  The other nurse was in the bathroom, wretching with the door open. </p>

<p>When Dr. K returns, Gail’s on his heels.  He’s been trying to tell her what he’s done.  She puts on a smile, for my sake, and I know this.  I can see everything in her eyes.  This is all wrong.  “How you doing?” she asks. </p>

<p>“Better than the nurses,” I say. </p>

<p>And so it is my true love who assists Dr. K, because no else has the stomach to do it.  If it was your beloved lying open on the table when you walked in, could you wear a face of calm?  Could you don the gloves and join the blood bath? </p>

<p>And when we finally leave, I am packed with saline-soaked gauze, equal in size to a large roll of Kerlex.  I could smuggle a regular red brick through an airport checkpoint.  A small cannonball.  I find it miracle that I can even walk.   </p>

<p>But I can.  And though The Wound—it gets a capital T and W because it affects my life and is as much of a pain in the ass as any person could ever aspire to be—The Wound diminishes, but it hangs around until the Saturday after Thanksgiving, demanding I take it on adventures, as if this hasn't been enough.</p>
