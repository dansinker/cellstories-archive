		</p><p>Doctor Mayhem captured me as I was going to my car for some smokes.</p>

<p>      I was almost to the roadside where I’d left the Suburban, looking forward to my first cigarette of the day, when a slight young man with a spotty beard and long pony tail came out from behind a tree and brandished a large blue knife. I recognized him immediately from the photograph I’d seen in the papers, not to mention the poster in the window of the gas station in Beloit.</p>

<p>      “Good morning,” he said. “Looks like today is your unlucky day...”</p>

<p>      Generally speaking, of all the possible misfortunes to befall campers in the deep woods—mosquito bites, sunburn, getting lost, meeting with dangerous wildlife—one does not anticipate America’s most wanted.</p>

<p>      Unlucky doesn’t really start to cover it. </p>

<p>      Among other things, Mayhem was wanted in connection to a series of attempted terrorist acts in Chicago including poisoning bulldozers, blacking out City Hall, a subway car derailment, an attack on a TV station and plugging up the plumbing of Buckingham Fountain. Most of these schemes didn’t come off, but Mayhem was nothing if not a tireless revolutionary. </p>

<p>      Just a couple days ago, his twelve year old henchman “Kid Apocalypse” was found by police holding a bag full of chemicals in a university steam tunnel. Mayhem narrowly escaped. It was believed he had fled to the Kettle Moraine forest of Wisconsin.</p>

<p>      And here he was.</p>

<p>      Mayhem produced a set of handcuffs.</p>

<p>      “Put these on,” he said, “or I’ll gut you like a fish faster than you can say Babe Winkelman.”</p>

<p>      Forgetting the overt and implied advice of crime prevention pamphlets, cop shows and serial killer movies, I did not run. If anyone ever asks you to come with them, statistics show you’re better off taking your chances now and running like hell while you’re free rather than allowing yourself to get trapped. What will happen later will probably be much worse.</p>

<p>      “You can take my wallet,” I said. “My car—it’s right over there. Take it. It’s yours.”</p>

<p>      Mayhem shook his head. “The cuffs,” he said. “Put them on... Now.” The knife was just inches below my nose where I could see the edge’s white, razor-sharp bevel. I had no doubt it could slice through the toughest of airport luggage to say nothing of my paper-like skin.</p>

<p>      Not thinking, I put the cuffs on like I was going along with a stupid magic trick. Once I did this, Mayhem relaxed a bit, the knife came down and I knew I had committed perhaps the greatest blunder of my life.</p>

<p>      Mayhem attached a piece of nylon cord to the chain between the cuffs and tied the other end to his belt loop.</p>

<p>      “Let’s go,” he said. “March!”</p>

<p>      We headed back into the forest going due north instead of east where my camp and friends were.</p>

<p>      As we navigated trails that were overgrown with dense foliage, I continued offering my captor whatever I could—my watch, my bank account, my promise to never tell a soul about this.</p>

<p>      “No sale,” he said. We stopped for a moment before a clearing and looked down on a canopy of trees. Trees as far as the eye could see. Mayhem noticed my orange baseball hat that was meant to protect me from hunters. He swiped it violently off my head and stuffed it under his flannel shirt.</p>

<p>      “So,” I said, “am I being held hostage then?”</p>

<p>      “Bingo,” he said. “Ding Ding. What do we have for him, Johnny?”</p>

<p>      “No need to be rude,” I said.</p>

<p>      “Come on, pick it up. We gotta get to camp.”  “You sure you want to do this?” I said. “You could be tacking ten to fifteen more years on your sentence. If you kill me, that’s life.”</p>

<p>      “No, if I kill you, that’s death,” Mayhem said, amused at his own joke. He had an unpleasant tittering laugh, the laugh of a teenage super villain.</p>

<p>      I tried another tack. Mayhem was reportedly something of a computer geek apart from his terrorist tendencies. I tried to appeal to this side of him by offering him my very rare and valuable X-Men comic books, my autographed copy of Kurt Vonnegut’s “Time Quake” and a vintage 1968 Barbarella movie poster.</p>

<p>      “Shut up, Shield,” Mayhem said.</p>

<p>      “What?”</p>

<p>      “That’s what you are to me—a shield,” Mayhem said. “You’re my ticket out of here.”</p>

<p>      “They’re looking for you, Mayhem,” I said. “There’s no escape. You’re best off surrendering as soon as possible...”</p>

<p>      “What makes you the authority on what I should do?” Mayhem said. There was that knife again. I had to be careful.</p>

<p>      “I’m a Spanish teacher?” I said.</p>

<p>      This made Mayhem laugh. That was good, I thought. The knife came down. We were walking again.</p>

<p>      A half hour later we reached the camp—a secluded recess in a hill with a tall rock overhang. There was a rolled up sleeping bag and a small fire pit dug into the dirt. Just inside in the crevice, I could make out a back pack and a laundry bag. I noticed a chain attached to a tree. Once I was connected to it, it allowed me about five feet in any direction.</p>

<p>      “So now what?” I said.</p>

<p>      Mayhem was crouched over the fire pit trying to set an empty bag of Doritos alight with his Bic.</p>

<p>      “I need to think,” Mayhem said. “The first step was to get a hostage... Now I plot.”</p>

<p>      While my captor plotted, a helicopter was suddenly heard in the distance. Its stuttering growl grew louder causing Mayhem to scramble into the crevice. He returned with a large green tarp and instructed me to cover myself and lay still. After I was hidden by the tarp, Mayhem crouched in his tiny cave.</p>

<p>      Once the helicopter was gone, Mayhem uncovered me and started poking at the ashes in the fire pit with a stick.  </p>

<p>      “You know you can’t hide up here forever,” I said. “You’ll get hungry. You’ll get cold. Right now your buddy, that kid they caught in the steam tunnel is probably telling them everything...”</p>

<p>      Mayhem stood up and spat.</p>

<p>      “Apocalypse betrayed me,” he said. “I should have seen that coming. I thought he was going to work out, become a true member of Freedom Team, but obviously he didn’t have the stuff. But just wait... When my next plan is unleashed, the city of Milwaukee will be brought to its knees.”</p>

<p>      Mayhem’s eyes sparked with a kind of insanity I had seen in some of my more unstable students, the ones I routinely sent to the dean or the social worker.</p>

<p>      “And what plan would that be?” I said.</p>

<p>      Mayhem started pacing the camp, slashing his stick through the air violently.</p>

<p>      “What Apocalypse had on him was nothing,” Mayhem said. “The real stuff is in that cave.” He gestured behind me to the laundry sack. “I have enough dynamite in there to blow the bejeezus out of the Mickelschnauzer Brewery...”</p>

<p>      Instead of asking Mayhem how depriving Milwaukee of one of their breweries was going to have any sort of lasting effect on the infrastructure of capitalism or democracy, I turned to more immediate concerns.</p>

<p>      “So how long are we gonna be up here?” I said. “The F.B.I. is already scouring the forest for you. The best thing to do is get out of here, pronto...”</p>

<p>      By now I figured my friends Nick and Steve must have reported me missing and maybe authorities had made the connection that Mayhem could have apprehended me. I hoped dogs were searching the area near my car and had picked up our scent. If we were to walk around, the better chance someone would find us.</p>

<p>      “No, tonight we stay put,” Mayhem said, concluding some warped electrical circuit in his twisted little brain.</p>

<p>      I sat down. “In that case, what’s for lunch?” I said. “I’m starved.” I also wanted a cigarette, but Mayhem, never one of the cool kids, told me he did not smoke.</p>

<p>      Inside the cave, Mayhem had a few cans of Hormel chili and a pot. After watching him mess around with getting a fire started for a half hour I finally begged him to let me do it.</p>

<p>      Ten minutes later we had a nice fire going and the chili was boiling, ready to eat.</p>

<p>      “We’ll have to share the spoon since I only have one,” Mayhem said. “I’ll eat, then you eat.”</p>

<p>      As I watched him scarf up the meat chunks, I almost became disembodied, seeing myself from above, noting how quickly life’s fortunes can change. One minute, I’m off on a quiet morning in the woods looking to kill my nic fit, the next I’m chained to a tree watching the world’s most ineffectual anarchist eat chili while the F.B.I. hunted for him.</p>

<p>      When it was my turn to eat, Mayhem started to awkwardly ask questions about my life.</p>

<p>      “So are you married?” he said.</p>

<p>      Remembering that it was good to personalize yourself as much as possible to a would-be killer, I lied and said I was.</p>

<p>      “Mary,” I said. “That’s her name. We’ve been married for three years now.”</p>

<p>      “You married Mary?” Mayhem said.</p>

<p>      I nodded.</p>

<p>      “Where’s your ring?” Mayhem asked.</p>

<p>      “Oh, I take it off whenever I’m camping,” I said. “I got a kid too—Joe-Joe. He’s six years old.”</p>

<p>      “Six?” Mayhem said. “You had him before you got married?”</p>

<p>      I cursed internally for being such a lousy liar.</p>

<p>      “Um yeah... He was sort of unexpected. We had to wait to get married,” I said. “We wanted to do it right, you know? We needed to save up money...”</p>

<p>      Mayhem seemed to accept that.</p>

<p>      “Little Joe-Joe...” I said, trying to reinforce the image. “He loves Kool-Aid. He drinks cups of it all day long.”</p>

<p>      “Sugar’s not good for kids,” Mayhem said. “It rots their teeth and makes them crazy.”</p>

<p>      “Yeah, I should watch that,” I said. “But it lights up his face whenever you give him a cup of it. He drinks it out of this little Popeye mug he has. It’s his favorite...”</p>

<p>      Would any of this bullshit spare my life? I hoped so.</p>

<p>      As night fell, Mayhem and I continued to talk. There wasn’t anything else to do. I learned all about how he was mentored in high school by a math professor named Kleinschmidt. About how the two of them had a falling out when Mayhem revealed his plan to flood the gymnasium. Soon after, Mayhem dropped out of school. Since then he’d been engaging in various diabolical schemes and started work on his manifesto. He had about two hundred pages so far, he said. The working title was “Technology And How It Will Destroy Us All”.</p>

<p>      “Catchy,” I said.</p>

<p>      As he enumerated the manifesto point by ridiculous point, I had the urge to slap this kid and jar loose the stupid ideas in his head. Yes, the world was messed up, I wanted to tell him, deal with it. Causing a few traffic snarls and dousing the mayor in darkness wasn’t going to do jack in the long run.</p>

<p>      Just before we turned in, we split a bag of peanuts and half a bottle of water. I was dreading the thought of having to sleep exposed on this little cliff all night wearing handcuffs. There could be bobcats, other animals that could have at me. When I mentioned this to Mayhem, he seemed a little bit sorry for me, but not much.</p>

<p>      “The revolution’s just around the corner,” he said. “You’ll have to get used to much worse than that before it’s all over. Revolution is coming sooner than you think...”</p>

<p>      With that, Mayhem retired to his cave to go to sleep.</p>

<p>      “No it’s not,” I said to the cave.</p>

<p>      “What?” came his voice back through the darkness.</p>

<p>      “I said ‘No... it’s not coming’.”</p>

<p>      No reply.</p>

<p>      I lay flat on my back and tried to get comfortable on my dirt bed. I thought about that bag supposedly full of dynamite not thirty feet from me. Was it stable or unstable? I wondered. I thought of Mayhem trekking all around the damp subways of Chicago with his cache of chemicals and explosives. It was incredible he hadn’t blown himself up already.</p>

<p>      When morning came, I had a total body soreness I hadn’t experienced in a long time. I felt like I’d spent the night in a boxing ring with a kangaroo. Having gone the first full day in fifteen years without having a cigarette didn’t help. It felt like ice water was running through my veins.</p>

<p>      “Well, I think it’s time we flee, Shield,” Mayhem said. He was pacing around snacking on a bit of candy bar.</p>

<p>      “Flee?” I said.</p>

<p>      “Yeah, your advice, right? Last night you said we should get out of here...”</p>

<p>      “Oh yeah. Yes, good idea,” I said. I stood and tried to stretch. Walking was going to be very difficult. Every joint in my body was screaming.</p>

<p>      “I thought I could wait them out maybe, but I don’t have a lot of food and I obviously can’t go into any stores... We need to get to your car...”</p>

<p>      I wanted to point out that from a not getting arrested standpoint, this would be about the dumbest move Mayhem could make since the authorities no doubt had somebody watching my car for this very development, but of course I played dumb.</p>

<p>      “Yeah, I could drive us someplace. Drive you, someplace,” I clarified, not eager to extend our relationship any more than necessary.</p>

<p>      “You think they have your car surrounded?” Mayhem said.</p>

<p>      “I don’t know. Maybe,” I said. “But what other choice do you have?”</p>

<p>      “Right. Right,” he said. “We should have taken the car right away. Now I see that tactical error...”</p>

<p>      Just then, from below the ridge, we heard voices and dogs barking. Mayhem’s eyes popped wide as he peered over the edge and confirmed his dreaded suspicion.</p>

<p>      “They’re here,” he said.</p>

<p>      “Who?”</p>

<p>      “The cops and the bloodhounds. They’re coming up this way...”</p>

<p>      “Don’t be stupid,” I said. “Just surrender. You’re young, they’ll have some mercy on you...”</p>

<p>      But Mayhem wasn’t listening. “The bastards!” he seethed. “This leaves me only one option...”</p>

<p>      “What option?” I said, alarmed. “There is no option!”</p>

<p>      “Yes there is,” Mayhem said. That evil glint was back in his eye as he crawled into the cave and started rooting around in the laundry bag.</p>

<p>      “What was that? What did you do?” I said when he came out a minute later. The bag was still in the cave. The dogs were getting closer.</p>

<p>      “You’ll see... Just tell the cops I’m hidden in the cave....” With that, Mayhem smiled and scrambled off the cliff side away from the police. There was a loud commotion of snapping twigs.</p>

<p>      “Other side!” I shouted to the cops. “He’s on the other side!”</p>

<p>      There was a lot of shouting then, and a squelched shriek that made me think Mayhem was no more. Meanwhile, I thought I could hear a crude time bomb behind me, ticking away the seconds.</p>

<p>      A bloodhound was the first to peer over the edge. It was barking its head off and then there were about five guys in blue vests with guns drawn on me. Two others were going toward the cave.</p>

<p>      “Don’t,” I said. “There’s a bomb in there.”</p>

<p>      That stopped the men. They seemed unsure what to do, so I spelled it out for them.</p>

<p>      “Get me the hell out of these cuffs!” I screamed.</p>

<p>      They weren’t in time. </p>

<p>      We all felt the bomb explode before we saw and heard it. A shock wave hit us, knocking us off our feet. Then there was a short but deafening roar and a cloud of smoke coming from the mouth of the cave. The explosion was impressive, but nothing on the order Mayhem would have hoped.</p>

<p>      When we all got our bearings and realized how miraculously, no one had died or sustained more than a ruptured ear drum, I resumed my entreaty to be separated from the tree.</p>

<p>      As I was guided off the cliff minutes later, I could see another group of men carrying the body of Mayhem away through the trees a bit ahead of us.</p>

<p>      “Is he dead?” I asked.</p>

<p>      “Stunned, that’s all,” a beefy fellow said. “Probably not used to taking the full brunt of a rifle butt to the head. It takes some getting used to.” </p>

<p>      That day and the next, there was the expected national news bonanza about the capture of the insidious domestic terrorist who called himself Doctor Mayhem. I was treated for minor abrasions by the hospital and given the card of a psychoanalyst which I figured I probably wouldn’t need. I was soon reunited with my camping buddies Nick and Steve and members of my family, all of whom had feared the worst.</p>

<p>      Steve showed me one of the newspaper articles as I was sitting in my hospital bed waiting for release to be authorized.</p>

<p>      I was being hailed as a hero by USA Today.</p>

<p>      Outside the hospital, this also seemed to be the prevailing belief among the throng of reporters who swarmed me as I was escorted into a waiting vehicle.</p>

<p>      “How does it feel to have saved Milwaukee? Do you feel like a hero?” they said, jamming microphones in my face.</p>

<p>      To be honest, I didn’t feel like a hero.</p>

<p>      I felt pretty much like a regular guy.</p>

<p>      Call me a Spanish teacher who could really use a smoke. </p>
