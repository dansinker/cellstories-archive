<h2>This is How You Will Die</h2>
	<h3>Danny Goodman</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>In the morning, Karen found the note on the floor just outside the apartment door. She had only been gone for a couple of hours and looked around for some sign of who had left the note, as only tenants of the building had access to the hallway. There was nothing, save for the snow tracked inside by her boots. She wondered if anyone had seen her leave, watched her walk across the avenue. Karen took the note inside, closing the door slowly and with care. She slid the lock into place without exhaling. She stared at the note, at the detail taken with each stroke of black ballpoint: this is how you will die. The only sound in the apartment came from the bedroom as Richard took swift, shallow breaths. Karen walked to the couch and sat down, the note gripped tightly between thumb and forefinger. The tips of her fingernails became white from the pressure.</p>

<p>      Karen remained that way for some time. Her heartbeats grew erratic as she stared at the small square of yellow paper. Richard stirred in the bedroom. He called out to Karen, but she didn’t respond. Again. Again. The force of his feet planting on the hardwood shook the apartment. She wondered how long he’d been awake.</p>

<p>      “Goddammit, Richard,” Karen whispered loudly.</p>

<p>      “Did you hear me?” Richard asked, walking into the living room. “I was calling you.” He tucked his hands into the pockets of his sweatshirt.</p>

<p>      “Stop moving. Please.” Karen looked at him and tried to be stern.</p>

<p>      “What the hell are you talking about?” Richard ran a hand over his bald head.</p>

<p>      Karen took his hand and pulled him onto the couch. She pointed at the note and mouthed What is this? as Richard grabbed a blanket from the back of the couch.</p>

<p>      “It’s cold in here,” he said. “Why are you dressed?”  </p>

<p>  “Do you see what this says?” Karen asked, letting her voice rise above a whisper.</p>

<p>      “Just somebody’s idea of a joke, Karen.” He seemed, to her, uninterested.</p>

<p>      “How the hell do you know that?  It was in front of our door. Who could’ve gotten into the building?”</p>

<p>      “People get in. It’s not rocket science.” Richard’s voice was deep and full of sarcasm. Karen wanted to smack him. Of course, though, she knew she couldn’t. He bruised so easily now.</p>

<p>      “Why do you have to make me feel stupid?” Karen asked, sliding away from Richard. There was room between them now. “Someone left a death threat on our door. I can’t be a little concerned?”</p>

<p>      Richard stood and walked into the kitchen, which was small and well manicured. He licked his thumb and rubbed at a spot on the stainless steel refrigerator.</p>

<p>      “How do these get here?” he asked, wiping the saliva away with his blanket.</p>

<p>      “We have to touch the refrigerator, Richard.”</p>

<p>      “There’s no need for marks,” he said.</p>

<p>      “Please come sit down,” Karen said. “We need to figure this out.” </p>

<p>      Richard opened the refrigerator, pulled out egg whites, soymilk, shredded cheese, toast. He lined each item up one by one on the countertop. He shivered and closed the door.</p>

<p>      “I’m making an omelet. Want one?” Richard grabbed a mixing bowl and scrambled together egg and cream and cheese. The sound of wire whisk meeting porcelain tinged in Karen’s ears. It grew louder before Richard was finished.</p>

<p>      “Richard, please.” She stared at him and hoped her eyes matched her concern.</p>

<p>      “What do you want from me?  I’m making an omelet. Give me a break.”</p>

<p>      The moment consumed Karen, and she ran over to Richard, gripping his hand and pulling it away from the stove. She pushed his fingers apart and placed her own in the created space.</p>

<p>      “Please don’t do that.” She squeezed his hand and felt his slow, rhythmic heartbeat.</p>

<p>      “What?” he asked, his cheeks wrinkling in confusion. Karen couldn’t remember the last time the two of them, in unison, smiled.</p>

<p>      “What if the apartment blows up?” she said.</p>

<p>      “Are you serious?” Richard said and grinned.</p>

<p>      Karen let go of Richard and walked back to the couch. She picked up the note and held it out in front of her. She pointed at the words. Richard left the ingredients on the counter, came to her and kissed her forehead. She nestled her head against his neck. His skin felt cold and stretched.</p>

<p>      “I think we should call the police,” she said.</p>

<p>      “Oh Jesus, Karen. Are you kidding me?” He pushed her head off of his shoulder and took a step back. “Some asshole’s playing a prank. End of story.”</p>

<p>      “You don’t know that.” Karen shook her head. “Maybe, but you don’t.”</p>

<p>      Richard stared at her, and she felt herself growing shaky and hot.</p>

<p>      “I’m turning the heat off,” she said, banging her hand against the thermostat. “It’s awful in here.”</p>

<p>      “You know I’m cold.” Richard sat on the couch and hugged his blanket.</p>

<p>      “It’s too much,” she said, clicking the switch to off.  </p>

<p>        A clang of metal rang in from outside. Karen went to the window and looked out at 9th Avenue. There was activity below as people set up for a street fair. Smoke poured from a long grill covered in unshucked corncobs. She could still see her footprints at the crosswalk, leading somewhere inappropriate. She thought of opening the window to let in the smells but immediately dismissed the notion. The window, she thought, might trigger something. Instead, she leaned her forehead against the glass and felt the cold seep through her pores.</p>

<p>      Across the avenue, in the building above Le Grainne Café, she could see his window. It was closed now, curtained, but she pretended he was there, her lover, looking back at her. She felt her body tighten, excited. Her breath clouded the glass.</p>

<p>      Then, suddenly, Richard’s body pressed up against her. His hands were icy, like the window. Karen felt him harden as he wrapped his arms around her waist. His fingers tickled her skin. He took her hand and guided it down the front of his sweatpants.</p>

<p>      “You have goosebumps,” he said softly.</p>

<p>      Karen pulled her hand back and shook her head.</p>

<p>      “We can’t,” she said. She shifted her eyes and spoke, as if she could see him. “The note, Richard.” She turned and faced him, wrapping her hands on his shoulders. They were smaller than they used to be, fragile. His muscles, too, had nearly melted away. She looked at him and wondered if he would make it through the winter.</p>

<p>      “Doesn’t the possibility of death make it all the more exciting?” he said. He smiled from the corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>      “Please don’t say that, please.” Karen took a step back and Richard followed. “What’s gotten into you?”</p>

<p>      Richard adjusted his sweatpants and blanket and returned to the couch. When he looked at her, his eyes glassy and a bit sunken in, Karen felt muted. There was guilt, resting on her chest and head and eyes like a heavy coat.</p>

<p>      “It would just be nice to be with my wife once in a while,” Richard said. “None of this is easy.” His voice cracked.</p>

<p>      He sounded to Karen, at that moment, like he was a teenager again. She thought she might tell him, then, about the affair. It was his right, after all, to know. After twelve years of marriage, she had forfeited her right to those types of secrets.</p>

<p>      “I’m trying, Richard,” she said, taking a seat beside him, letting her leg drape over his. “I really am. It’s just difficult.” Karen kissed his cheek. “I hate that you’re sick.”</p>

<p>      He tasted different now, smelled different, and she tried, with every fiber of her being, to ignore it. She couldn’t leave him, not like this, not now. He was dying, after all. Whatever she felt, whatever impulses pushed at her insides, she knew, at the center, was her responsibility to Richard, to keeping him comfortable. In the end, though, she feared that was all she was capable of.</p>

<p>      “What would you have me do, Karen?” He stared at the note when he spoke.</p>

<p>      In the space between his breaths, Karen wanted to say something to fix her husband.</p>

<p>      “We should call the police,” she said. “There’s nothing else to do.”</p>

<p>      Richard grabbed his cell phone and walked into the bedroom, leaving the note on the table with Karen. She picked it up then smacked it against the tabletop. Her hand throbbed. Outside, on the street below, she could hear voices growing. The curtains she longed to hide behind across the avenue remained still and undisturbed. Karen wished the window and glass were not so clear. She could hear the wind howl down 9th Avenue.</p>

<p>      “They said not to worry,” Richard said, coming out of the bedroom. “They’ll look into it, they said.”</p>

<p>      “What does that mean, look into it?” Karen slammed the note down onto the table. The table shook. “What happens to us in the meantime?” Her voice was pulled tight, and she hit the tabletop again. Then again. The old legs of the table teetered and wavered and finally gave way. Afterwards, almost instantly, the apartment was still. Karen could hear Richard’s breathing, fast and fitful. He pulled his blanket tight around his body.</p>

<p>      “I’m putting the heat back on,” he said, moving to the thermostat. “It’s too damn cold.”</p>

<p>      Karen stared at the broken table on the floor and scooped out the note. She read the words over and over in her mind and noticed how pronounced and familiar the black words seemed against such a bright background. Each time she read, she focused on a different word: this, how, you. Suddenly, she found that Richard was standing in the kitchen, watching her. He looked petrified. There was something else, too, something new. Karen felt it, almost immediately, as her husband held his gaze: he knew. About everything, maybe. She had broken him and the cancer had broken him and soon, so soon, he would be dead. She crumpled the note in her hand and wished the words had never existed. Richard, though, she knew, needed them to. He shivered as the heat flowed back into the apartment. There was a distinct smell to the heat, Karen noticed, and she wondered if it had always been there. It reminded her of winter, of the wind and snow and iciness just outside the window.</p>

<p>      Tossing the note back onto the oak, Karen went to Richard. She settled her body into his, pulled him close as tightly as she could. Richard opened his blanket and covered her shoulders. There was warmth there. Karen thought to ask if he wanted to finish breakfast, but she didn’t want to speak. She leaned into her husband and believed, for a moment, that he was holding her up.</p>
