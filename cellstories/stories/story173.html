<h2>Rage Against the Machine</h2>
	<h3>Kristen Fiore</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p> So, my friend Liz and I, we were at the Staples Center, in Downtown L.A. It was August of 2000 and the Democratic National Convention had come to town. We weren’t <i>technically</i> at the Convention, meaning <i>inside</i> or anything. We were in this parking lot turned protest area outside, with around 10,000 people and at one end of the parking lot, Rage. Against. The Fucking. Machine, was playing Killing in the Name Of. </p>

<p>      On the stage, at least 5,000 bodies between us, Zach De La Rocca screamed into the mic. Liz jumped up and down beside me with the music, her long curly brown hair smashing into my face.  In front of us a tornado of a mosh pit swirled up an enormous cloud of dust and all around us were bodies swayed with the music. </p>

<p>      “THIS IS AWESOME!” Liz screamed into my ear. </p>

<p>“FUCKING RIGHT THIS IS AWESOME!” I screamed back.  </p>

<p>      We high fived each other, sweaty palm against sweaty palm and then I grabbed her shoulders shaking her so hard she started to laugh and cough and laugh some more. </p>

<p>      Even after seven hours of waiting in the sun. Even after 9 other songs, I was still just as excited as I had been at nine that morning.  </p>

<p>      I guess it seems silly now, 10 years later, to be THAT excited about a concert, but, I mean, I was 18 and this was a free Rage Against the Machine concert, and they were still COOL in 2000 and we were in a parking lot with these huge chain link fences running down the length of it, making it like a concert in a prison yard and honestly, I had been living in Los Angeles for almost a year, a whole entire year, and up until that point, nothing I found at all exciting had happened to me. Seriously. Nothing. Well, … maybe that’s not entirely true.   </p>

<p>      I had been having “fun” with Liz, who I had met a few months before, was my first and only friend in L.A.  She was 19 and part of a really ‘cool kids’ crowd.  The kind that gets Reality shows on MTV like The Hills and shit? Yeah. THOSE kinds of kids.   </p>

<p>      We went to these huge Hollywood parties in mansions with gates that made them into a fortress and that probably had their own zip codes where people’s shoes cost more than my rent. We were on VIP lists at fancy clubs, the kind with leather cubes that pass as seats and girls dancing in cages (ok she was on the VIP lists and I was her plus one) but none of that was MY kind of fun.  It wasn’t the kind of fun my actual friends and me always had in New York, but this concert?  THIS was my idea of fun and even Liz was having fun. Both of us acting like REAL teenagers for the first time since I met her.  </p>

<p>      I was just so excited to finally be having fun that it took until Rage reached the middle of the song, for me to notice that Liz was just standing still. I turned from the stage to face her and grabbed her shoulders. She looked like shit. Her face was bright red, her blue eyes the size of dinner plates and leaking tears. </p>

<p>      “ARE YOU OK?” I screamed. </p>

<p>        “I FEEL SICK,” Liz screamed back, a tremor rising out of the middle of her voice.  </p>

<p>      I was instantly irritated and concerned at the same time. I had convinced Liz to come with me and now I felt ultimately responsible for her having a good time. I took her hand and I pulled her through the crowd, pushing people out of our way until we were on the far right of the parking lot and we leaned against the chain link fence. </p>

<p>        “I DUNNO,” Liz yelled into my ear. “MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE JUST STAYED HOME AND WATCHED THIS ON T.V. LIKE CHAD SAID” </p>

<p>        “FUCK THAT!” I screamed back. “CHAD IS A FUCKING IDIOT.” (pause) </p>

<p>      So, Chad. Right. Chad was my boyfriend at the time, the reason I dropped out of my freshman year in college at NYU and moved all the way from New York to Los Angeles a year before this concert. He edited movies for Paramount Pictures and shows like Dawson’s Creek. A month before the DNC came to LA, he started editing porn. Like one day he just woke up and thought “It would be so awesome to look at penis and vagina all day long.” Yeah, then a week before the DNC, he told me he had ‘accidentally’ slept with a porn star. Like he tripped over a pipe and OOPS his dick slipped right into her twat. It was OK though! He had said, because it was her job! and it didn’t mean anything! Then to top it all of, because yes, it does get worse, Chad was THIRTY. YES. Thirty years old. He was 12 years older than me. I was Eight. Teen.  </p>

<p>      Yeah. He was a total catch. </p>

<p>      So maybe, I was kind of also at the concert because I had a little bit of anger to get out.  Just a little. Like [--] this much. (pause) It worked too, even though Liz was leaning against the fence looking like death, her face totally white, I was feeling FANTASTIC, that is until Liz screamed: “I WANT TO GO!” </p>

<p>      Ok. So in hindsight it was a reasonable request.  We’d been there all day and had run out of water three hours before the concert even started and both of us were visibly exhausted. But I wasn’t READY.  Leaving meant going back to Chad and going back to pretending that bars with red lighting that served flavored oxygen was my kind of FUN.  It wasn’t! I didn’t want to go back to it!   </p>

<p>      Around me, the whole crowd was chanting “Fuck you, I won’t do what you tell me,” their middle fingers raised in the air, swaying back and forth with the music.  Liz grabbed my hand.  I looked at the stage and then back at her. At the stage and then back at her.  I had to choose. I couldn’t. I had never said no to Liz! She was my only friend. And I mean, she didn’t know a fucking real thing about me – because I had convinced myself that my lame life in New York (that I missed so fucking much) wasn’t cool enough for her. Sure, she knew a person who wasn’t actually me, but she was all I had outside of Chad. If I lost her, I literally had nothing.  </p>

<p>      Then, from the back of the crowd, at the entrance, little white lines of light started shooting into the air and I was excited again. I was like “AWESOME! YEAH! FIREWORKS!!!!!! THAT IS FUCKING AWESOME!!!” Only as it turns out that it wasn’t fireworks at all. It was tear gas. Crazy little fact to remember for any future riots you are part of:  When tear gas guns go off, little lines of white light shoot out into the air. Just. Like. Fireworks. </p>

<p>      “DO YOU SEE THAT?” I yelled at Liz </p>

<p>      She went to respond, and the music cut off. </p>

<p>      The lights on the stage died, nothing but parking lot lights flicking above us making everything orange. The crowd paused, Everyone quiet. I swear, I could hear a pin drop. Then from the far left of the stage there was a voice through a megaphone: </p>

<p>      “I am commander Brennen of The Los Angeles police department. I hereby declare this be an unlawful assembly. If you remain in the area, regardless of your purpose in remaining, you will be in violation of section 409. You have 15 minutes to disperse.”  </p>

<p>      The moment he was done speaking the quiet stopped and EVERYTHING exploded. People were running in every direction -- climbing up the fences, crawling OVER and under people.  The people in front of me pushed toward the stage and the people behind me pushed toward the entrance. I found myself ducking under arms and jumping over legs, just trying to stay upright. That is until the tear gas finally hit me.   </p>

<p>      I could try and be really cool about the tear gas, right?  Be all like, “OHHH tear gas?? Psssh. That shit is weak.”  BUT OH MY GOD DID IT HURT. I have ever experienced pain like that. It was as if someone had doused my skin with gasoline and lit a match.  My eyes instantly started watering. Actually watering is a understatement.  BUCKETS OF WATER POURED FROM MY BODY.  Then I tried to something really stupid: breathe.  So, ok, Let this be my second word of wisdom to you for any future riots you might be a part of, if they shoot tear gas at you, DO NOT BREATHE IN.  I swear you will thank me later. </p>

<p>      And you know what? I probably would have gone down, right there, except just a few hundred feet away from me, were the police.  A whole entire sea of them, some of them on horses. HORSES and most of them on foot. And they were grabbing people by the arms, hitting them with riot batons, pressing their faces to the ground and Shit. I was NOT about to get arrested for going to a concert. Right? So I turned around.. and I ran. </p>

<p>      Only, everyone was now doing the same thing and there was no where to go.  Behind me, people screamed: “WE HAVE NO WHERE TO GO!”  </p>

<p>      In front of me people screamed: “WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO??”  </p>

<p>      Then the crowd started to break open just as I heard a woman scream: “THEY ARE SHOOTING AT US!!” </p>

<p>      My heart was in my ears. My skin was on fire.  I had lost Liz somewhere between the lights going off and tear gas and I looked for her for a second, but she was gone. Behind me the sound of rubber bullets hitting the concrete was VIBRATING in the air. I pushed through the crowd, clawed through, and then… it happened. </p>

<p>      So, sometimes when I tell this story, like when I’m telling it to a really hot guy, I like to be real tough. I say real cool things like “Oh? That bullet?? That was nothing.”</p>

<p>      The truth?  THAT SHIT FUCKING HURT.  It hit me right in the back of the head on the right side of my neck and I fell face down on to the sand covered pavement, cracking my cheek open.   </p>

<p>      In those next few minutes, as I laid there bleeding, crying, my neck throbbing, in the few minutes before I passed out, I thought, “This is it. I am going to die.” And you what???? I was REALLY PISSED! I was going to die. In a parking lot. At a Rage against the Machine Concert. I was going to die at 18, my last known boyfriend a 30 year old who edited porn while I ran around Los Angeles pretending to be someone I wasn’t. I WAS GOING TO DIE NOT EVEN KNOWING WHO I WAS. I WAS GOING TO DIE WAITING FOR MY LIFE TO BEGIN. MY LIFE. MY WHOLE LIFE. NOT JUST TOMORROW, BUT MY LIFE.   </p>

<p>      I woke up in an ambulance, blood caked to the side of my cheek. then spent hours in the hospital for a CT scan that I am still paying off and I was alone, because Chad was off in the Valley looking at fucking cock and pussy When I finally got home, Chad was there, wearing his really dingy, tighty whities, with no shirt on, his hairy chest matted with sweat, drinking wine from a bottle, watching Star Trek reruns. </p>

<p>      “I’m leaving,” I announced loudly, almost yelling. </p>

<p>      Chad jumped up off the couch. His belly shook and his penis poked through the opening of his underwear. “Is this about the porn star?” he asked, “Because I told you, it’s her job to have sex so it’s not a big deal. I didn’t even LIKE it, that much.”  </p>

<p>      Yeah, like I said, a total keeper  </p>

<p>      I held down the urge to vomit. I couldn’t believe this had become my life, you know?  Most of all, I couldn’t believe that he didn’t even know I was unhappy. </p>

<p>      “This is about me,” I said. “I’m leaving because I need to go find out who I am.” </p>

<p>      And that’s exactly what I did. </p>
