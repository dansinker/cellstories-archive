<h2>A Trip to Greek Mythology Camp</h2>
	<h3>Joe Meno</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p><h4>1</h4></p><p>In the mail, from an ad she had found in <i>The Christian Wife’s Pious Housekeeping</i> magazine, my mother received a brochure for The Teen Institute Training and Nature camp, which she had sent away for with the Holy Ghost’s permission, to keep me from another summer dedicated to Dungeons and Dragons and huffing Carbona carpet cleaner. Last summer, there had been an incident where I had disappeared for two days and had been found sleeping in the backseat of my mother’s station wagon with magic marker on my chest that read, “I am Galdar the Destroyer” after one particularly intense gaming session some evening.</p>

<p><h4>2</h4></p><p> <i>TITAN</i>, the brochure read in bold letters, with a silver thunderbolt and gold chariot exploding through the middle of a formidable Greek-inspired font. The brochure described a month-long summer camp where teens could meet other teens with similar interests in history, arts and crafts, and Greek mythology, all in a beautiful and safe, natural Ohio woodland setting. <i>The camp will work to foster your teen’s self-confidence and allow for the development of ever-necessary social skills,</i> which in my case, were definitely lacking. In the glossy brochure there were color photos of a handsome boy, slick as an eel, swimming in a false blue lake, another of a beautiful young blonde girl working at a ceramics wheel making an impossibly intricate urn, and another of two good-looking teenagers, a boy and a girl who could have been television stars, with smiles like denture ads, dressed in white tunics and drinking from gold goblets and simply laughing. <i>Does your teen have a hard time fitting in?</i> the brochure read. <i>Why not go to a camp where meeting other, liked-minded, intelligent teens is easy?</i> My mother handed the brochure to my father, nodding her head and smiling. “What do you think, son?” she asked me.
<br> 
<br>            “OK,” I said. My father looked at the brochure then at me and walked out of the house, sighing. In a moment, like an argument, we could hear things breaking in the garage then the sound of the lawn mower starting.</p>

<p><h4>3</h4></p><p>I had drawn a dirty picture of a girl. The girl in the picture was someone I had fallen in love with in my history class in my high school. I had never spoken to her. She was a redhead and her name was Madeline. Other girls in class called her Maddie. The picture was taken away from me in class and then sent home to my parents, who, at once, seeing it, realized the worst of their fears, that there really was something wrong with me. And perhaps my dad, being a man, had secretly gathered, from the anatomically retarded drawing, that I was still an inexperienced virgin or worse, a budding homo at the age of sixteen. “This is unacceptable, Josh, unacceptable,” was all they could say. The look of disappointment on my father‘s sturdy gray face was equal to the way he had received news of my brother losing his entire left leg, the year before, in a training accident in the army.</p>

<p><h4>4</h4></p><p>“I heard you were going to Geek Vasectomy camp,” Eric Peters shouted as I turned down the block on my bike, home from school for the day. Eric Peters lived across the street and had red freckles and was two years younger than me, an eighth grader. All of Eric Peter’s brothers were wrestlers. All of them were big and tough. Eric wasn’t big yet, but he was tough. He would wear his older brother’s singlette and ear-pads around the neighborhood, this red and white wrestling leotard with matching headpiece, and he would try and practice his wrestling moves on me.</p>

<p>              “It’s mythology camp,” I shouted back. “It’s about Greek gods.”</p>

<p>              “Can I borrow your bike while you’re gone?” he asked.</p>

<p>              “I guess.”</p>

<p>              “Can I try it out now?”</p>

<p>              “All right,” I said. I hopped off and handed it to him. The bike had been a birthday present last year. It was gold and black and had a thunderbolt on the frame. Eric hopped on, rode it around a little and nodded. “Not bad, not bad,” he said. Then he sped off down the block, turned and began pedaling as fast as he could, right towards me. I knew what was going to happen before it did. Eric’s beady black eyes squinted tight as he let out a howl, “Eric Peters is Number One!” and at the last moment, he hopped off the bike, dove into the grass and laughed as the front tire of my bike slammed hard against a tree.</p>

<p>              “Ghosted!” Eric shouted.</p>

<p>              “That’s great,” I said, lifting the bike up. The handlebars were bent all the way to the left and one of the forks had a very large dent. “Great,” I said and sighed, walking away. <i>Eric Peters, you foolish mortal,</i> I thought to myself. <i>You have made a deadly foe, a deadly foe this day.</i> I imagined sewing him up in a burlap sack with hundreds of cloves of garlic and dropping him over the city walls to a pack of hungry, wild dogs or decapitating him and mounting his head on a great gold lance. As I was fantasizing, I heard:</p>

<p>              “Eric Peters is Number One,” and suddenly he surprise-attacked me with a full nelson I could not escape or contend.</p>

<p><h4>5</h4></p><p>In the picture I had drawn in class, the girl was naked and her back was turned. In class, the girl sat two rows ahead of me, and all I could do was imagine how she would look naked like that, the soft slope of the back of her long white neck, her shoulders only hinting at her warm, soft curves. In the picture, her hair was almost black.  It was done entirely with gray pencil. The thing was, though, there was a man in the picture, who had a large horse head instead of a man‘s head. And a sword. He was holding the sword and leaping, naked, atop Madeline, whose long white arms reached up to embrace him. Tears of joy flew from the side of Madeline’s face, and the man with the horse head was also inexplicably crying. I didn’t know why I drew them crying really. My mother asked if either one of them was in pain. I only shook my head. <i>They’re just in love,</i> I said.</p>

<p><h4>6</h4></p><p>At the camp, I got off the sour milk-smelling bus and followed the rest of the kids into a large wood cabin that read in gold letters, “ZEUS CABIN: HEAD COUNSELOR ONLY”. I had hives from the black vinyl seat creeping up and down the back of my legs and I hadn‘t eaten since that morning. “OK,” the camp leader, <i>Dave</i>, it said on his name badge, “How many of you kids ever have been to any kind of summer camp before?” he asked. A few kids, a chubby-red-faced boy, a girl with a baseball hat on, and an Asian kid in overalls, raised their hands. Dave nodded his head. He was thin, with wild brown hair that was longer in the back and he had a light brown beard. He wore a gold cardboard laurel wreath above his ears, and a short purple tunic, which showed his knobby knees. There was a silver whistle dangling around his neck. He was thin, with large calves, and he shifted his weight from leg to leg as he spoke. “OK,” he said. “This place…well, this place is going to be a lot different. Here we wear tunics and stay up late. So it’s going to be better, a lot better than…well, anything.”</p>

<p><h4>7</h4></p><p> TITAN probably had been a great summer camp when it first opened in the fifties, but now it was as dingy and wrecked as a sunken ship. In the center of the camp was a great coliseum, made completely out of wood, but it hadn’t been painted in years and was dusty with paint chips. One side had fallen in on itself and had been graffiti-ed with black paint that said <i>Suck it!</i> and <i>Eat pussy!</i> There were stone carvings of Greek gods and heroes and monsters; Hercules, Hermes, the Hydra, Medusa, hiding in the dense woods along the paths, but they had been grown over with mossy filth or broken, missing arms and noses, or worse, like the statue of Eros, the god of love, which was covered with like eight or nine brightly-colored used condoms. The outhouses were lit up pink and named the Oracle, with flashing lights, and there were speakers that piped harp music inside, but most of the speakers had been blown and now only crackled with wiry fuzz.
<br> 
<br>             “I’ll be honest. We have a problem here at TITAN,” Dave announced at the opening day meeting. “Transients. And migrant workers. And Mexicans. They all camp here during the off-months and spring and come back in the fall. They stay here so they can work at the paper factory and they make a goddamn mess of the place,” he shouted and then he lowered his head and his laurel wreath tipped shamefully. “So every night, two kids will be on patrol. They’ll have this flashlight to use.” He held up a shiny silver flashlight and shook it. “And this whistle. If you see any transients, just blow the whistle and flash the light in their eyes. They can’t stand the light. Also, we’re low on supplies so if you can get away with one piece of toilet paper, well, that would be nice.”</p>

<p><h4>8</h4></p><p>The boys were all instructed to meet down by the lake on the first day. The lake was green and covered in fuzzy yellow and white moss. A few weak-looking willows ran about the shoreline in a sad circle. “All right, then, everyone take off your clothes,” Dave shouted, blowing on the whistle. “It’s time to commune with the Greek god Neptune.”</p>

<p>              “What?” the Asian kid asked, holding his hand to his ear as if he hadn’t heard right.</p>

<p>              “Take off your clothes right now, Asian kid, and go for a swim,” Dave instructed again. He blew the whistle and took a seat on the shore, then began digging at his palm for a splinter that seemed to be bothering him. The Asian kid shook his head, but no one else argued. The Asian kid just stood there for a moment and watched, and I stared back at him, feeling more uncomfortable than I had in all my life, and then as the teenage boys around me began to disrobe and their soft white bellies and acne-scarred spines began to appear, I bent over and began unbuckling my pants as well. Out of the corner of my eye, out of curiosity, I glanced at the naked boys around me. The Asian kid sighed finally and began lifting off his shirt, muffling his crying. In another moment, however, we were all in the water and splashing about and it was if we had been born that way, naked, amphibious, daring. The Asian kid floated on his back and even seemed to be smiling.</p>

<p><h4>9</h4></p><p>On the second night, in the dank, mildewed cabin, which was named Hercules and written in silver cursive, just above the entranceway, I lied in bed and listened to a flute somewhere being played. When I couldn’t sleep, I climbed out of the bunk and stood by the foggy glass window. Outside older boys and girls in white tunics, tied tight with gold cords, were chasing one another and laughing. A tall girl with brown hair came running past the window and a boy with dark eyes and a budding mustache came after her. He grabbed her around her middle as she let out a laugh and began kissing her neck. I turned away then turned back again and his hand had disappeared somewhere along her middle. Just then, along the side of the girl’s cabin, Cassidy Ponce appeared, a short blonde girl with glasses, who I decided I loved right away. After a chance encounter outside the craft hall, where she accidentally stabbed me with a pair of safety scissors, I had been watching her all week. Now, there, outside the girl’s cabin, some older boy with a mop-cut hair was trying to kiss her open-mouthed. But Cassidy Ponce just kneed him once in the groin then marched away, tilting her head back, and laughing loudly.</p>

<p><h4>10</h4></p><p>“I want to be sent home right away,” the Asian kid, George, shouted. “If my parents knew what was going on here…” He stood up in the middle of the dining hall, which was referred to as the Kingdom of Demeter, and threw down his fork.</p>

<p>              Dave, itching his brown beard, came over and patted the boy on his back. “Well, Asian kid, here we settle things with the sword,” he whispered, nodding wisely. He walked over to a wall and removed a heavy silver broadsword and handed it to the boy, then turned and chose for himself, a great spiked mace.</p>

<p>              “What?” the boy whimpered.</p>

<p>              “If you want to go home, you’ll have to best me. Go on, Asian kid, best me! Best me!”</p>

<p>              The boy thought for a moment, trying to lift the sword then shook his head and let it drop. Dave lowered his mace, patted the boy on the back, and walked away.             </p>

<p><h4>11</h4></p><p>“In the spirit of ancient Greece, a land in which all of you would already be married, today you will be assigned your husband and wife for the remainder of your time here at camp. If you have not already chosen one, one will be chosen for you. Tony Briggs, you’ll be with Cassidy Ponce. Mark Malloy, you’ll be with Angie McGribbs. Josh Lundton, you’ll be married to Lucy Anders. Ares Cabin you‘ll be with the girls from Aphrodite Cabin. Argonaut Cabin you’ll pair up with the Wood Nymph Cabin. John Ford, sorry pal, but we ran out of girls so you‘ll be married to me.”</p>

<p><h4>12</h4></p><p>All the girls were instructed to spend the night with their husbands for at least the first night. The girl, Lucy, who had been chosen as my wife was sixteen, brunette, and a diabetic. She warmed me not to offer her any kind of candy whatsoever and then laughed, patting down her heavily hair-sprayed hair. She also had a wicked-bad case of eczema, this river of bright red sores that ran from one corner of her mouth all the way down her throat. She was skinny and laid in bed beside me, silent, trembling, waiting, in a pink football jersey, which I guessed had been her older brother‘s but had been ruined in the laundry. She closed her eyes, pulling at the corner of the jersey, and I looked at her, placing my hand between us, wanting and not wanting all of the same things at the same time. Finally, I chickened out, and pretended to fall asleep, and Lucy huffed and turned over, kicking me several times throughout the evening.</p>

<p><h4>13</h4></p><p>“In the Elysian Mysteries,  Hades, the god of the underworld falls in love with Persephone, a human girl, and kidnaps her, and tricks her into eating a pomegranate seed from the land of the dead, which means she has to go back to the underworld for part of the year for all eternity.”</p>

<p>              One night, as I am out on camp patrol, alone, I go to the Oracle-themed outhouse, and struggle looking for toilet paper. I find this myth in its entirety scratched into the bottom-side of one of the toilet seats. I think it might mean no matter what, you can’t change certain things Or maybe you can change certain things. I am not so sure, though, because like all the Greek myths, it might mean anything.</p>

<p>              Moments later, as I stumble out, I run into Cassidy Ponce, the short perky blonde girl with huge bifocal cat’s eyes glasses, the girl I have been “watching from afar” all week. “Hey,” she says. “You’re in Tony’s cabin right? Hercules cabin?”</p>

<p>              “I think so. Tony, the guy with long hair in the back? Or short, fat Tony?”</p>

<p>              “With the hair in the back,” she smiles. “I go to high school with him in Grand Rapids.”</p>

<p>              “You do?” I ask.</p>

<p>              “Yeah, I guess that’s why they made me marry him.”</p>

<p>              “You’re married to him?”</p>

<p>              “Yeah. It’s not so bad. He keeps his hands off of me because he knows I’ve got friends who’ll kick his ass.”</p>

<p>              “What are you, I mean, a girl like you doing here?” I blurt out suddenly.</p>

<p>              “I don’t know,” she frowns, pushing her huge glasses up her nose. “I heard they had a unicorn.”</p>

<p>              “A unicorn?”</p>

<p>              “Yeah, come look,” and she takes my hand, her hand so small, like a child, and we run through the dark, down a path, me, breathing hard, and we stop before a huge white concrete statue of a unicorn, its pointy-head lowered sadly.</p>

<p>              “It’s a grave-marker,” she says, and points to the etched lettering.</p>

<p>              “A grave-marker? You mean they had a real unicorn here?” I ask.</p>

<p>              “Back in the seventies, you know? They took a miniature horse and grafted an antelope horn on its head. Its name was Hermes.”</p>

<p>              “Like the Greek messenger?”</p>

<p>              “Right. It used to tour around with the circus and then some animal group found out and so they had to keep it here. It only died last year.”</p>

<p>              “Wow,” I say, sad that’s all I can come up with.</p>

<p>              “And, well…forget it,” she says.</p>

<p>              “No, go on,” I say.</p>

<p>              “In China, there’s evidence that there really used to be unicorns. They think they were hunted to extinction.”</p>

<p>              “Really?”</p>

<p>              “Really. I have like eight hundred books about them at home.”</p>

<p>              “Unicorns are cool. I guess I’m more into the heroes, and monsters, Cyclops, stuff like that,” I say.</p>

<p>              “Yeah, I kinda‘ figured,” she says.</p>

<p>              “So,” I say.</p>

<p>              “So. Do you have any friends who like this kind of stuff back home?” she asks.</p>

<p>              “No. I don’t think anybody here does.”</p>

<p>              “Yeah,” she laughs, pushing up her glasses. “You’re probably right.”</p>

<p>              “What about you?” I ask. “You got a cool jock boyfriend or anything?”</p>

<p>              “No, no, I got a neighbor who‘s like a senior who comes over and makes out with me.” She pushes up her glasses. “I know he just does it to piss his real girlfriend off. But this conversation is getting very interesting, huh?”</p>

<p>              “Yeah,” I say.</p>

<p>              “Well, so I’ll say it. I’m still a virgin. It’s not like I’m a freak about it or anything, I just don’t really date, I guess,” she says.</p>

<p>              “Well, sure,” I say. “I get it.”</p>

<p>              She pushes up her glasses again.</p>

<p>              “So do you want to take a walk down by the lake or something?” I ask.</p>

<p>              “I don’t think I should.”</p>

<p>              “You don’t think you should?”</p>

<p>              “I don’t think I should. I‘m married to someone else. In ancient Greece, if a woman was caught with another man, she‘d have her genitals torn out and pulled up over her head.” I can’t tell if she is joking or not. I touch her shoulders and feel the heavy material of the white tunic in my hands. In my life, I have never touched another person so gently.</p>

<p>              “But…” I whisper.
<br>            
<br>  “I am married to someone else,” she whispers again, and this time, closes her eyes to be kissed.</p>
