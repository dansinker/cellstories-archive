<h2>Ripples in Glass</h2>

	<p>
		</p><p>When I was very young, I remember asking my grandfather why he was a Baptist minister. He explained that “the Church is THE place I always find joy. I have had the best times of my life in church.” 
<br> 
<br>“I get it, just like my sandbox.” 
<br> 
<br>“Yeah, just like your sandbox.” He responded. 
<br> 
<br>My Dad, Big Jim Walker, had a place like that, too. Not the church, not the sandbox--but his garage. 
<br> 
<br>His garage. It was an oversized deal, big enough for two cars, a  workshop of tools and his neighborhood famous bar-b-que pit on wheels. After dinner, that is where my dad would be found. He was always the last one to get home. I am sure that by the time he got home it was full chaos. Three boys under fifteen, the endless bickering it only stopped when we slept.  See, I have two older brothers. The oldest, Jamie, is left handed. Since he is lefty and the oldest, he got special treatment. For example, he had a special pair of scissors that no one else was allowed to use and he got to be in charge when my parents weren’t home. My other brother, Kenny, did not have his own scissors. I think he blamed me for this fact because he was relentlessly cruel to me. Worst of all, when my parents and Jamie were not at home, Kenny was in charge.  </p>

<p>Naturally, I relished the time I had at home alone—I was a “Latch Key Kid.” Ahh, to be eight years old and in charge of my own destiny! I grew up in a time when you could give a kid a key on a long leather shoelace, place it around his neck and let him take care of his own lunches and after school activities and call it responsible parenting. If I hurried, I could get home at 3:30, an hour before my brothers. I would use the time to do secret things, like, play with matches and Lysol or something even more forbidden: steal pieces of cake. Everyone in the family knew that Kenny never sliced cake. He always sawed it, leaving behind the tell tale sign of Kenny cut cake. So, if I wanted to indulge in an elicit piece of cake, I would cut Kenny style. He got in trouble for it every time. 
<br>The sweetest revenge is petty.  
<br> 
<br>So, I arrived home from school. We typically entered the house through the side door. But as I neared the door, I noticed movement from the backyard. I knew no fear. I went back to investigate. In my backyard was a massive Rottweiler, black and menacing. It looked identical those evil hell hounds in the movie ‘The Omen” that made Gregory Peck wet his pants. Satan’s own minion in my backyard, pooping. </p>

<p>Who the hell do you think you are dog? I yelled, “Hey! Hey, get out of my yard dog!” The beast just looked at me and continued his effort. </p>

<p>I suppose it was unreasonable to expect anyone, dog or human, to discontinue such an activity at my beckoning. That section of the backyard was my sandbox. That was where my friends and I spent hours with our army men and matchbox cars. Now, the beast was converting my sandbox into his litter box. I took it as a personal affront. </p>

<p>I was enraged.  I picked up one of the rocks that separated lawn from bushes and chucked it at the offending animal, well, not exactly at him. The stone went about 20 degrees to the left, shattering the garage window. </p>

<p>It may have been my back yard, but it was definitely my dad’s garage. He had built it two years earlier. Not had it built, built it.  The only assistance he had was in hanging the double-wide garage door. It took Dad and my best friend’s father, Mr. Eggleston, several tries and many beers to get it perfect. It took him the better part of a summer to build it and now, I had destroyed a part of it. </p>

<p>With the shattering of the glass the beast fled, taking with him any pride I had in my pitching arm. When the dog left a fog rolled in, or maybe it was tears of fear that welled in my eyes. </p>

<p>I had never broken a window before. At eight, glass had a touch of magic. You could see through it as though it was not there at all, yet it held at bay the brutal winters of Cleveland, Ohio. Plus, my brother Kenny had told me that glass was actually in its liquid state. That it moved so slowly that it seemed like a solid but because of its viscosity it was actually a liquid. That was why, he said, in really old buildings, the glass looked wavy like ripples on a pond. It took a very long time but if you sat in a time machine you could watch glass flow like syrup. Magic. Something so supernatural must be tremendously expensive, valuable and difficult to replace. </p>

<p>There was a basketball hoop placed at regulation height above the wide garage door. On that door were three large windows side by side. We knew if we wanted to play basketball we had to raise the garage door. We knew this because my father said more than once, “if you want to play basketball, raise the garage door, ‘cause if you break a window…” Dot. Dot. Dot. It was the dot, dot ,dot that scared us believing the real punishment could be worse than the one imagined. </p>

<p>I should take a moment to mention my father’s brand of justice, a word I use loosely. “Swift” and “merciless” are the first two words that come to mind. If he was in a good mood or even calm he ordered us to get ‘the belt.’ My two brothers and I knew exactly which belt was ‘the belt.’ The belt, we called it Malvolio, because Jamie said Malvolio from <i>Twelfth Night</i> hated any kind of fun or games. (Jamie started reading Shakespeare when he was nine because it was “cool”) Malvolio was a vicious looking belt that looked as though it were made during the dark ages. Not that it looked old or worn out, just menacing. It was a wide, black leather strap that had rows of three hole that ran its length spaced every half inch or so. My bothers and I speculated that the holes were intended to increase Mavolio’s aerodynamic performance and thus its spank-ability.  </p>

<p>Getting a Malvolio spanking was frightening but honestly, I don’t remember it hurting. It was a ritual of bark nit a ritual of bite. A spanking with Mavolio was usually preceded by my father saying something ridiculous like, “you asked for this,” and I would think, “Nuh-uhh.” On the other hand, my dad’s temper could get the best of him and he would show the worst of himself. 
<br>His most violent, angry reaction occurred the summer before on a family vacation. We made the very long drive from our home in Shaker Heights, Ohio to Montreal, Quebec, about 600 miles. </p>

<p>We filled the Bel Aire station wagon with our luggage. We all got into the car. My father turned the key in the ignition and I asked, “Hey Daddy, when we get to Montreal can I go swimming?” </p>

<p> “Of course” my father answered. </p>

<p>I had been told that the hotel had an indoor swimming pool. INDOOR! I mean, how cool is that? I was seven and I did not know that something like that had even been invented. I had thought about it during the winter, how fantastic it would be to have a pool inside that you could swim in during the snowy months. I had dismissed the thought, thinking it must be impossible or else there would be one in our neighborhood. So when I found out that not only did an indoor pool exist but it was at our destination, I was overflowing with excitement.  </p>

<p>We were nearly out of the driveway when I asked, “When we get to the hotel, I can go swimming, right Daddy?”  </p>

<p>“Yyyup” </p>

<p>By the vacant lot on the corner I asked again. Again as we passed Scotty’s Five and Dime. It kept occurring to me how unbelievably magnificent it must be to swim in a pool that was inside a building. The notion that this ecstasy could be missed or somehow forgotten by my parents kept reoccurring to me and was all too horrific. I needed assurance! </p>

<p>“Hey Daddy, swimming at the hotel, when we get there, that’ll be OK, right?” </p>

<p>Cleveland Heights, Willoughby Hills, Mentor. “Daddy?” </p>

<p>Painesville. Ashtabula. “Can I?” </p>

<p>Erie, Pennsyvania. “SWIMMING?” </p>

<p>By the time we got to Buffalo, New York, my father snapped. He bellowed, “If you ask me about swimming one more time before we get to the hotel, I am going to smack the shit out you!” </p>

<p>I was scared. I didn’t know how hard a smack would have to be in order to make a kid soil his Fruit of the Looms but I was pretty sure my dad could smack that hard. He was a giant to me. He could still pick me up and put me on his shoulders with ease. I was certain that he was one of the world’s strongest people and he could certainly beat up Charlie Hall’s dad. </p>

<p>My father’s graphic imagery created a visual in my mind that distracted me for about 23 miles, when a new question suddenly entered my mind; Was I not allowed to go swimming? Or was I just not allowed to ask about it until we got to the hotel? It was killing me. Could I go swimming? I didn’t know. </p>

<p>Rochester, New York. Syracuse. Would I swim? I certainly wasn’t going to ask before we got to the hotel, at least not out loud. </p>

<p>The Saint Lawrence Seaway. Canadian Border. Agony! </p>

<p>Finally: the Hotel Ste. James, Montreal. The five of us entered the hotel room: my mother first, carrying only her purse and the room key, my two bothers and I each carrying a small suitcase, followed by my father who was laden with multiple suitcases like a pack mule on a mining expedition. I waited.  I let him put down the last of the four suitcases he was carrying. I even gave him a moment to take out the handkerchief that he kept in his back pocket so he could wipe the sweat from his brow. I had been patient long enough. Through a broad yet determined grin I asked, “Daddy, can I go swimming now?” </p>

<p>I never saw it coming. He smacked me in the face. It hurt so bad that I couldn’t cry. I was stunned. Everyone was stunned. The hotel room was silent except for the ringing in my ears. In a daze I walked to the bathroom mirror to see what this kind of pain looked like. There, on my face, was a perfect imprint of his hand like one of those plaster art projects you do at camp. When I looked very closely, I swear I could even see the ridges of his fingerprints- the stroke had left such an impression on me. </p>

<p>If this was the punishment for asking to go swimming, what was he going to do when he found out that I had destroyed the miracle called glass? </p>

<p>I raised the garage door to see if anything could be salvaged. I immediately saw that I was dead. My first thought was, “How can I frame Kenny for this?!” But this was no piece of cake. There was no way I could fix this; there were too many tiny shards of glass. </p>

<p>I panicked. My next move would only make sense when you are eight years old. I ran to my room, slammed the door and hid under my bed. </p>

<p> “Of course,” I thought, “I can hide under my bed until this whole mess blows over. I can sneak out late at night and eat brownies and cinnamon toast. Eventually they’ll forget about the glass and just be glad to see me.”  </p>

<p>While I was working out the details of my master plan, I heard my oldest brother Jamie downstairs. I knew it was Jamie because I could hear Elton John’s Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy playing on the stereo. If it had been Kenny I would have heard Pink Floyd, but Elton John meant Jamie. </p>

<p>After some time, I started to see the impracticality of my “hide under the bed until they forget about me” plan. Then, I did something I had never done before nor since: I asked Jamie for advice. I told him about and showed him the window. </p>

<p>Jamie told me the best thing to do was to tell our father what had happened as soon as he got home. Seven years older and that is the best he could do? This? I had to keep in mind that this was the same guy who told me to put a bobby pin into an electrical outlet, but to lick my fingers first. </p>

<p>This honesty is the best policy crap didn’t feel right. But my brother was being uncharacteristically nice to me and he even helped clean up the glass.  </p>

<p>I don’t want to make my father seem like a monster or a petty tyrant. A couple of overzealous slaps and an occasional visit from Malvolio is nothing compared to the punishment his father meted out.  My father was whipped with an electrical cord when his father wanted to teach him a lesson. They say my grandfather had been missing three teeth from the time he was fourteen from a beating he had received from his father and that his father was beaten with an ax handle. My great great grandfather had been a slave so who knows how he was punished. The point is: each generation had done better then the previous generation. </p>

<p>When my father arrived home I told him the story of the dog and that I threw the rock. When I told him that I had broken the window, to my surprise he wasn’t angry at all. He took the opportunity to teach me how to replace a window. Change, like the ripples in glass, can take generations. </p>
