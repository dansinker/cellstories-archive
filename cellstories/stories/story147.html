<h2>The Hugging Bandit has a Bad Day</h2>
	<h3>Ellen Neuborne</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>Women are always crying and carrying on about how the men in their lives did them wrong. But if you ask me, men are not the problem. To get screwed beyond all fixing, you need another woman. Believe me, I know.  
<br> 
<br>I mean, who said all I had to do was keep my nails clean and pray to Jesus and I’d be happy? Sister Mary Margaret – thanks for nothing. Who swore we’d never get caught and then split out the back door so I got nailed holding the cigarettes in the girl’s locker room? Rebecca Joosten – who I hear is doing time in Massachusetts for unpaid video store fines. Who told me I should marry Barry Gould because nobody better was going to crawl through the state of Vermont anytime soon? That’d be Mom. Barry lasted a year before he ran off with a ski instructor. Add up all the times I’ve had my ass handed to me and you’ll find a sister. The world would be better off if men laid eggs.  
<br> 
<br>It was even a women that had me out on the street that night, freezing my butt off, trying to walk around and stay warm until my janitor job at the university started. Scrubbing toilets wasn’t much of a career move, but the building was heated. In Burlington in February, that’s a motivating factor. Problem was, UVM paid on the 15th. Mrs. Savage collected on the first. For months, I’d been able to juggle it, but this time she had a replacement roomer – a Canadian trucker with cash in hand. Next thing I knew, I was hauling my stuff up Church Street, blowing on my hands and cursing a lot.  
<br> 
<br>The bars on Church Street were starting to fill up. Locals and ski workers, college kids and tourists, refugees from the eco-vegan-commune. I’d tried to get a bar job. Guys in their 30s can get bar jobs. It’s okay for a bar tender to look a little ragged. Gives the place an air of authenticity – like it’s a real dive not just the clever construct of the city planning commission. But a girl in a bar has to be pretty and perky and stacked with nice white teeth. Again I’m screwed by my own team. Whatever.  
<br> 
<br>But it was later that same night that I got my bright idea. In the stacks of the science library, I had scrubbed my assigned sections and was now killing the last hour of my shift surfing the Internet. I caught up on Tom and Katie, cruised Travelocity, pretending I had money to spend, and then hit CopsCopsCops.com, my favorite news site. It’s full of stupid stuff people do to get themselves locked up. <i>Yeah, officer, I thought it was my mother’s Meth so I was driving it to her house and when I saw your lights and sirens, I figured I’d better get out of your way so I floored it…</i> What a bunch of losers.  </p>

<p>It’s enough to make being a 30-year-old semi-homeless night shift janitor not so damn bad. I was reading the Buffalo police blotter when I saw it.  
<br> 
<br>“Male bar patron, 45, reports wallet was stolen by girl who hugged him when the Sabres scored. Victim states crime happened three days ago. Claims it took him that long to sober up and notice the wallet missing. Cannot describe girl, bar or wallet contents. Recalls Sabres won 3-0.”  
<br> 
<br>I thought about Church Street – and about the dozens of guys who stumble out of those bars after last call, drunk and dazed.</p>

<p>The next night, I called in sick to UVM and went out to Church Street. It was 1 a.m. It was so cold the hairs inside my nose froze every time I inhaled. I walked up and down the two-block stretch, but everyone who emerged seemed too sober to make a likely prospect. After 2, I was about to give up when he came lurching out of T Mann’s Tavern, alone and singing.  
<br> 
<br>“Miners fight! Miners fight! And we’ll put up another win. Miners fight! Miners fight! And we’ll … dum, dum da dum dad dum. Rah rah!” 
<br> 
<br>Anyone who can’t remember their fight song is good and pickled. I stuffed my hat and scarf in my pocket and my hair flew loose in the night wind.  
<br> 
<br>“Hey, baby! Looking good!” I smiled and sauntered toward him, arms wide. “Hey, how ‘bout some sugar?” 
<br> 
<br>You’d think I was wearing a bikini instead of a brown wool overcoat, the way the lout smiled back at me. “Hey yourself good-looking!” (Now I know he was drunk.) “Come to papa!” 
<br> 
<br>And he entered the embrace. I wrapped my arms tight, tried both coat pockets and bingo, hit the leather billfold. I let him hang on a second or two longer before I pushed off. “You come back soon, you handsome devil,” I called to him as I walked away.  
<br> 
<br>“You know it, honey. I’m a heart breaker!” 
<br> 
<br>Well, he sure made my heart flutter. I ducked into the alley by Elliott Books and checked: $85. I made $85 in less than a minute. Beat the shit out of $5.15 an hour. I was on to something.  
<br> 
<br>That first night, I hit three guys and pocketed $145. By the following week, I was averaging more than $200 a night. I learned to pick my targets, watching for signs of cash-carriers: dark, glossy jackets, no hats – those were tourists up from Boston or New York City. Sports parkas and Ugg boots, the après ski crowd. REI logos signaled the college kids. I learned to avoid certain coat combos. The layered look – wool barn jacket over hoodies – those were working men. Local guys. Unless it was Friday night, they’d have nothing in their wallets but ID and an expired Costco card.</p>

<p> 
<br>Over the next month, I perfected my moves. Side coat pockets were easiest, but lots of guys used the back pants pocket. I learned to duck and weave to the side a bit to reach around. I made a point, to handle the wallets just once. Flipping and ditching them all over Church Street might attract attention. Instead, I made a night’s haul, picked a dumpster or trashcan, and did the cash lift. 
<br> 
<br>With a steady source of money, I began to make some changes. I told UVM they could take their toilet plunger and shove it. I moved out of Mrs. Savage’s dump and got an actual apartment. Still on the north side of town, but with a door that didn’t use a padlock and a kitchen that didn’t use a hot plate. I got cable, to give myself something to do during the hours I waited for my clientele to get good and drunk. And I started saving up for the cradle.  
<br> 
<br>I already knew which one I wanted -- the hand-carved Walnut one at Green Mountain Antiques. I priced it once. “You don’t want to know,” said the asshole clerk, looking me over.  But that’s when I knew this was the one -- so pricy that having it had to mean I was ready to be a good mother, right? I don’t see how the social worker could say no to giving him back to me when I had a cradle like that.  
<br> 
<br>I checked my cop’s site regularly. No sign Buffalo ever caught its Hugging Bandit. That’s probably because the city has a shortage of women or something. Because finally, the second half of the population caught up with me.  
<br> 
<br>The night it happened, Duke was playing UConn and the bars were packed. Standing out on the bricks, I could hear the howls and cheers coming from every door. The street was crawling with my potential paychecks.  
<br> 
<br>The first guy I got was a college kid – wearing a UConn jacket. Candy from a baby.  
<br> 
<br>“Go Huskies!” I shouted opening my arms. “Hug for Huskies!” 
<br> 
<br>“Woo hoo! Huskies rule!” He responded, stumbled into my arms, and made easy back-pocket pickings of his Velcro-close wallet. $72.  
<br> 
<br>Yellow and black Columbia ski parka: $50  
<br> 
<br>Duke sweatshirt, shaved head painted blue: $120. Always a thrill to get the guy who just won a bar bet. He was still shouting “From downtown baby, waaaaay downtown!” as he walked away from me and off into the night.  
<br>I made one bad call. The long black wool overcoat turned out turned to have lovely Coach wallet in his pocket containing all of $3. Plus, he stank. A Guinness drinker. Blech.  </p>

<p>But I also made one eagle-eye catch. The guy in the plaid wool short coat looked like a local worker at first. But his feet told another story. No mustard colored chucks. This guy had on shiny black boots with a tassel. A tassel? Not on any worksite I’ve been to. I hugged him: $107. Can I read ‘em or what?  
<br> 
<br>I was well on my way to a record night. I had all the wallets tucked into the lining of my coat. I was trying to decide if I should bag it for the night or give it one more sweep. Another fat one and I might even be ready to go back and put down a fist full of cash and take that cradle home. That’d be sweet. I was picturing myself setting up the cradle in my apartment. That’s when I saw him.  
<br> 
<br>He came out of Aubrey’s Ale House. He was wearing a leather bomber jacket with a gloss that made you squint. He had the fur collar turned up and an iron-perfect scarf around his shoulders. No gloves. No hat. No decent footwear. Bull’s-eye: a flatlander.  
<br> 
<br>I moved in. “Hey there, handsome. Looking good tonight, baby.”  
<br> 
<br>He smiled and stumbled half in my direction, half down towards the curb. 
<br> 
<br>“Whoa, honey, careful there,” I wanted to move fast before he passed out or puked or both.  “Look at you, all dressed up. How about a hug for me, good looking?”  
<br> 
<br>He obliged and I worked quickly. The bulk of my previous picks made getting close a challenge. Plus his coat had real leather trim instead of polyester so the edges of the pockets didn’t give. I got my hand in and grabbed. Nice fat wallet.  But I was having trouble getting my wrist loose when it happened.  
<br> 
<br>“Slut!” 
<br> 
<br>The hit upside my head made me see stars. But it wasn’t enough to bounce me loose. I was still stuck in the damn jacket.  
<br> 
<br>“Whore!” This time she brought her purse right down on top of my head. I fell out of the coat then and hit the curb. I hugged my coat to keep my stash from spilling out. She continued her rain of insults and purse slaps.  
<br> 
<br>Finally, I got to my feet and noticed we three had attracted a crowd. Damn. I stumbled up and began to run. As I lurched down Church Street, I could hear the commotion behind me. “That’s her. The girl just came out and attacked her! Beat her to the ground!” 
<br> 
<br>Just my luck it’s Good Samaritan Night at Aubrey’s. Half of them whipped out their cell phones and called for help. Church Street had cops at both ends in minutes. And when one of them grabbed me I knew it was all over.  
<br> 
<br>I was an hour chained to the office chair in the station while two uniforms sorted out my night’s take. Would you believe Tassel Boots was actually the son of the sergeant? I damn near told him his kid’s a poof. But I figured I had enough trouble. Turns out, my work was not going unnoticed. Most of the Burlington drunks, it seems, have some standing over the Buffalo fellas. Many were able to say where and when they lost their wallets. I heard the desk job pick up the phone and call the local newspaper. “We got the Hugging Bandit,” he practically shouted. Well, nice to make somebody happy.  
<br> 
<br>“This way, please,” he said as he uncuffed me and hauled me down the hall. Finger prints. Another search. And then toes to the yellow line and look this way. A beefy lady cop with a graying ponytail stood by the camera. “Smile, sweetheart!” she said.  
<br> 
<br>Stuff it, sister. Just stuff it.  </p>
