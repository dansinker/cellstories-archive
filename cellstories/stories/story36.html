<h2>All Other Ground is Sinking Sand</h2>
	<h3>Daniel Muro LaMere</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>With a history as a circus promoter, George Wellington Streeter, Captain of the 35-ton Reutan steamboat felt a certain affinity for the ridiculous. A sudden July thunderstorm precipitated his passengers’ decision to take the train back to Chicago, leaving Captain Streeter, his devoted Maria, and a handful of crewmembers (none of which had the luxury of such a choice) to press on through the gales and whitecaps, leaving Milwaukee behind just as quickly as they could.* Having survived the Civil War and, later, evading an elephant attack, Streeter felt that he could also conquer the storm. As tends to happen, however, disaster struck just as the Reutan was nearing home.  She ran aground on a sandbar not far from Chicago’s water tower. It wasn’t until the following morning that Cap Streeter was able to take stock of his new environs; despite his wrecked vessel and disastrous landing, he felt somehow more invigorated than he had since fighting the Rebs in Tennessee.  
<br><blockquote>
<br>*Accounts differ with regard to the purpose of the Milwaukee trip.  While many refer to Streeter as a “steamboat operator and excursion guide”, at least one account calls the voyage to Milwaukee a dry run for a gun-running operation George and Maria hoped to spearhead in Honduras.  This is not completely ludicrous: according to a New York Times article from January 27, 1886, “A local newspaper publishes this morning the following article: ‘There has been a good deal of suppressed excitement among men in Chicago during the past few days over reports received from the agent of a syndicate of Americans searching for gold in Honduras.’”  Where there is gold, there is likely to be guns as well. 
<br></blockquote></p><p>In the age of Mark Twain, Streeter himself was something of a larger-than-life character. His moustache was a dominant presence on his face, hanging nearly to his chin. Yet where Twain appeared unkempt, rugged, a wild thing of nature, Streeter was more refined. He was a small man, surprised by all that he encountered--including, it seemed, his own existence. So he appeared through the looking glass of one N. Kellogg Fairbank, magnate of the N. K. Fairbank Co., who had been able to sell enough five cent cakes of Fairy Soap to procure for himself one of Chicago’s most exclusive addresses. </p>

<p>Upon waking, Mr. Fairbank had, as he did each morning, his breakfast of one banana and a cup of coffee brought to him in his bedroom.  He stepped into the bathroom, splashed his face with cold water (no soap), and returned to take his meal at a small table by the window.  His wife snored quietly in the bed.  Reaching for his coffee he noticed something resembling a boat about four hundred feet out from shore. From Mr. Fairbank’s vantage point, it appeared as though the boat were a model constructed, rather carelessly, by a child. With the aid of his looking glass, however, he was able to confirm that the vessel was full-sized, even if its captain, whom he now spied breathing in the morning lake air in full pajamas and nightcap, was not. </p>

<p>      “Myrna.”</p>

<p>      “Yes sir,” came a voice from the hall.  Myrna was a slight Irish girl, barely twenty years old, whom the Fairbanks kept in their employ for all of their domestic needs.  She stood now, red-faced and out of breath, in the middle of the room.  “Is there something you’d like?” </p>

<p>      Mr. Fairbank’s gaze remained fixed upon the water. He had done so much in life, but he’d always dreamed of a life behind the captain’s wheel.  Like so many powerful men, his successes were merely a metaphor for that which had escaped him.  “Myrna, I’d like you to send a boy out along the sandbar to that man, to ask him if there’s anything he needs and to give him permission to remain until his boat is repaired.”</p>

<p>This rare moment of generosity on the part of the tycoon was due in large part to the fact that his wife wasn’t awake to talk him out of it. It was also predicated upon the belief that the captain would, in time, see fit to fix his vessel and sail away. What Mr. Fairbank could never have predicted, however, is that a character so unscrupulous as to have promoted the circus and plotted some sort of Central American arms-trading adventure would have little qualms about altering a municipal sign in the dead of night: </p>

<p>      <b>No Dumping</b></p>

<p>      CITY OF CHICAGO </p>

<p>     </p><p>with a little bit of paint, a little bit of moxie, can easily become: </p>

<p>      <b>Dumping $5</b></p>

<p>         See Boat Captain </p>

<p>     </p><p>And it did, and so Captain George Wellington Streeter was able to amass a small fortune while also creating for himself--by way of construction debris and captured sand--186 acres of prime Chicago real estate. For Streeter the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 was truly great, as it produced a construction boom the likes of which the city had never seen, and he was more than happy to build his empire upon its offal.</p>

<p>      This was not the way that the Fairbank fortune had been made, and so the very notion that Streeter was able to combine brazen outlawry with what can only be described as dumb luck was enough to turn the soap peddler’s world on its ear. Weeks went by, during which N. Kellogg Fairbank continued to take his breakfast at that small table by the window, his gaze still fixed on that spot upon the water, a spot which continued to grow in size as time elapsed. “Something must be done,” he would hiss, the venom in his words drowned out by his wife’s snoring, the cherry finish of the chair’s arm wearing away under the firm grasp of his white-knuckled hands.  “Something must be done,” as he recalled a conversation with an acquaintance from the <i>Tribune</i> at the club the other night: <i>They say this fellow down on the lake set up shop over at the Tremont Hotel. Say he’s selling plots of ‘land’--if you want to call it that--to anyone who’ll pay. Calls it the District of Lake Michigan, and says that the “deestrick” is only under the jurisdiction of the Federal government. Seems to me someone ought to do something.</i> “Something must be done,” until he got tired of hearing (or not hearing over the snoring) himself say it, and one day rose from his breakfast, took his shotgun in hand, and walked to the shore.</p>

<p>      By this time, the Streeter clan was no longer housed in the Reutan, but in another boat that had also serendipitously run aground at Streeter’s shantytown. Upon examining the abandoned vessel and seeing its <i>Castle</i> moniker festooned upon its rather ample hull, Streeter gathered up his people and property and moved them from one shipwreck to the other. It was to this latest shipwreck that Fairbank set out.</p>

<p>As Mr. Fairbank had never been in the Civil War, had never lived among circus performers, and had never lived outside the gentry, it can also be said that he had never before approached another man, shotgun in hand, evil in his heart. Streeter, on the other hand, had learned at a very young age of the cruelty of the world, and of the need to guard his belongings with his life. In this latest chapter of life, this had meant giving parcels of land to members of his crew and a select few whom they would recommend in exchange for armed sentry work. Fairbank didn’t have a chance. Young Peter Zabrocki saw him huffing along his east lawn towards the encampment and opened fire, alerting the other guards to do the same. It wasn’t long before Fairbank was scampering away, returning to the safety of his home to draft a desperate, angry letter to his lawyer.</p>

<p>While Fairbanks’ lawyer was doing what he could to win court cases for his wealthy client (illegal squatting, selling liquor without a license, etc.), old N. K. decided that he needed some Civil War muscle on his side. To this end he enlisted the help of Allan Pinkerton’s private security firm, the Pinkerton’s National Detective Agency--or simply Pinkerton’s. If the Pinkertons could (as they had) foil a plot to assassinate President Lincoln, certainly they could run Streeter off of his homemade marsh. </p>

<p>In the end, it wasn’t the Pinkertons, or Fairbanks, but rather the Chicago Police Department, some twenty-eight years later, who finally ran Streeter from his empire--which as this point he was calling “the Oasis.” And just as with later arrests of high-profile Chicago criminals, the charge for which Streeter was ultimately brought in was not the one that made him a target: he was charged with violating the law against selling liquor on Sundays. Despite a number of outgoing shots coming from within the Oasis, this time around, no one was injured. According to the <i>Times</i> (November 15, 1915), “On Oct. 12 last Mrs. Streeter shot and wounded a policeman who had arrested her husband on a charge of selling beer without a license.”  And even in these late years, Streeter had succeeded in enlisting his tenants in the Oasis’ defense with varying degrees of success: “Harry de Carmaker, 17, who lives with Streeter, was found shivering on a cake of ice in a refrigerator guarding the supply of beer with a rifle.  He surrendered without firing a shot.” </p>
