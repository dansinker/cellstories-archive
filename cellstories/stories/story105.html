		</p><p>“I want to show you something,” said Mirabella, “but first, can I have your bracelet?”  I looked at my bracelet, a thin elastic band that held different colored candy hearts I could bite off.  I hadn’t had a single one yet. </p>

<p>“That depends,” I said, “how special is what you’re about to show me?”  We were entering a small wooden shack that stood a distance through some woods at the edge of Don Camilo’s farm.  Mirabella turned and put her index finger against her lips, cautioning me to be quiet.  With the other hand she opened the door.  The one-room shack was dark but neat.  To our left was a small fireplace; to the right, a table and two mismatched chairs sat opposite on either side of the table; and in front of us, a bed with a window just beyond it.  Burlap strips that had been torn lengthwise had been nailed over the window to serve as curtains.  They flapped gently in the dusty breeze.</p>

<p>The bed was almost ornate compared with the rest of the furnishings.  It was a large four poster bed, polished to a dark rich brown, simple in its design.  The edge of the starched white cover sheet rested lightly against the wooden floor.</p>

<p>“Ohhh!,” I said.  “This place is almost spooky!”</p>

<p>“Shhh!,” warned Mirabella, “don’t let them hear you!”</p>

<p>“Who!,” I asked looking around.</p>

<p>“The birds of this place, ”she whispered.  Her ponytail hung down her back and shiny black bangs brushed her eyes.  She squinted and pushed them back with her hand.</p>

<p>She was wearing a worn powder blue dress that was too big for her.  The sleeves and hem hung low, covering the many scabs on her tanned knees and elbows.  Her feet were bare and she stood with one foot behind the other, her arm wrapped around the bedpost, her hand lightly caressing the polished wood.  She sighed and dropped her hands, swinging them at her sides restlessly and looking around the room.</p>

<p>“Los pajaritos” she repeated moving around the bed to the window.  She lifted a strip of burlap and looked out into the field that bordered the woods.</p>

<p>“You know, my mother used to come here when she was a little girl,” she said.  I moved to the side of the bed and saw a plain wooden crucifix hung above the head.</p>

<p>“Who lives here,” I asked her.</p>

<p>“Las brujas called ‘las nenas’,” she answered without turning.</p>

<p>“Oh,” I said and sat down on the bed.  I took the bracelet off.</p>

<p>“So, these witches, are they good ones?”  I asked, tossing her the bracelet.  She turned and caught it.  She looked surprised at my question and rolled the bracelet onto her wrist.</p>

<p>“They’re like you and me,” she said shrugging, “I don’t know, what does that make them?”</p>

<p>I shrugged in return. “They’re called las nenas,” I said.  “They’re little girls?” She shrugged again and turned back to the window.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, they’r like you and me.  They’re twins,” she said absently looking out.  She seemed to be expecting something as she peered out, then smiled briefly.  From where I sat, I saw only the woods.  Finally, she let go of the burlap strip and turned looking slightly irritated.  She stood for a second and tapped her foot on the floor, hands on her hips and looked at me.  “Well,” she asked impatiently.  “Do you want me to show you or don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Well yes!,” I said throwing my hands up.  “That’s what I’ve been waiting for!  Where is it?”</p>

<p>“You’re sitting on it,” said Mirabella folding her arms and looking at me with a smile.  I jumped up from the bed.</p>

<p>“What, it’s got bugs in it?”  I checked my shorts and shirt and ran my fingers through my ponytail.</p>

<p>“No,” said Mirabella, “look under the bed.”</p>

<p>“No,” I said firmly, “you look under the bed.” I turned around and headed for the door.  “I’m leaving.”</p>

<p>Mirabella jumped onto the middle of the bed on her knees and said, “Graciela, are you being chicken?” I turned back.  She was on her hands and knees and her hair hung over her shoulder and brushed against the bed like a long black tail.  Her dark eyes were squinted, teasing.  She reached down with one hand in front of her and very slowly lifted the sheet that rested against the floor.  I watched curiously, bending slightly to peer beneath, but there was nothing there, not even dust bunnies; just a clean wooden floor.  Mirabella giggled.  I looked up at her.</p>

<p>“Look,” she insisted, her black eyes were intense, but a smile played around her lips.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing there,” I said moving closer.</p>

<p>“There <i>is</i>,” said Mirabella, “but you have to <i>look</i>.” I sighed and knelt on the floor.</p>

<p>“Okay,” I said and then bent down and looked again.  “Nothing.”</p>

<p>“I’ll look from the other side,” she said and I heard her bounce on the bed.</p>

<p>“So, what am I supposed to see?,” I asked impatiently waiting to see Mirabella’s face appear upside down on the other side under the bed.  Nothing.</p>

<p>“Mirabella,” I said raising myself to look on the bed, “wha—”  But she was gone.  In her place on the bed was a large black crow.  It cawed and stared at me with one shiny black eye and then flapped awkwardly over to the edge of the bed in front of the window.  It stretched its neck to peck at the burlap and cawed again.  The sound was enormous in the small room.  It continued to peck and caw and look back clumsily at me through the side of its face.  The room felt airless and sweat beaded up on my upper lip.  I moved slowly to the window and then lifted one of the burlap strips.</p>

<p>With a dark rustling of its wings the bird flapped onto the window ledge.  It cawed loudly and as it passed me, it pecked my index knuckle, then it was gone.  A bright red drop of blood welled up on my knuckle.  I let go of the burlap strip and backed away from the window, putting my knuckle to my mouth and sucking on it.  I turned to leave, but stopped short.  In the center of the bed lay the candy bracelet I had given Mirabella.  Outside the crow cawed repeatedly as it flew away.</p>
