<h2>Holding Our Breath</h2>
	<h3>Aimee Perkins</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>In my grandparent’s house in western Minnesota there is a glass front hutch in the dining room where my grandmother keeps every dish she has been given over the course of her almost sixty year marriage to my grandfather.  There is the original set of wedding china they got as a setting for four that grew slowly over time to encompass the serving bowls and platters that were needed to outfit a table large enough to accommodate the nine children they would eventually have.   </p>

<p>On top of that hutch is a picture of my mother taken for her graduation from nursing school.  She is in her early twenties and is wearing nursing whites with a navy blue wool cape folded over her shoulder to show the red lining.  Her white blonde hair is in a bob and her smile is much like Mona Lisa’s.  The peaked hat and composed expression make me think of war time nurses and the soldiers who fell in love with them. </p>

<p>About five years ago I was sitting in that dining room with my grandparents, my sister Shannon and her daughter Brooklyn.  It was late August and we were both in early to take advantage of a couple of days with my grandparents before the rest of the family descended for our family reunion.  Once we were all present, there would be more than fifty of us stuffing the house- sitting on every available chair, sleeping in every available bed and converting the garage into the same makeshift dining hall it was turned into for every family gathering.   </p>

<p>But before it was all of us, it was just the couple of us there, after a quiet dinner.  My grandmother had made a pot roast with mashed potatoes and green beans from my aunt Joanie’s garden.  Homemade rolls and chocolate cake from scratch for dessert.  Hers is the only table I sit at where a gallon of milk is put on with the salt and pepper.   </p>

<p>“Sit down, sit down.”  She shooed me away as I tried to help her with the dishes.  “Grandpa wants to teach Brooklyn how to play Kings Corners.  Go help him.”  </p>

<p>My sister was at the counter pouring herself a cup of coffee and said, “Kings Corners.  Wow, I haven’t thought about that in years.  We used to play that for hours.”  </p>

<p>“I know,” I said.  “Grandpa might have to teach me how to play again.”   </p>

<p>From the table I heard the slap and shuffle of a deck of cards and my grandpa said, “Well then, get over here so we can get started.”   </p>

<p>My grandma said, “I’ll be done in a jif.  Go play- I’ll be right there.” </p>

<p>We sat around the table me with my back to the hutch, grandpa on my left, Shannon on my right and Brooklyn across the table.  My grandpa patiently went through the rules of the game- “Remember, they have to be opposite.  You play the red ten on the black jack and go like that down to one.  Do you want me to help?”  </p>

<p>Brooklyn shook her head.  Her brown eyes already concentrating on the cards in her hand.  “I can do it on my own.”   </p>

<p>I looked up over her shoulder and exchanged a glance with my grandma who then raised her eyebrows and looked over at Shannon, making a silent remark about how much Brooklyn was like Shannon, growing up stubborn and independent already.  
<br>Having played a few hands and gotten the hang of it, Brooklyn looked up from her cards to the top of the hutch behind me.   </p>

<p>She pointed to the picture of my mom and asked, “Who is that?”  </p>

<p>Shannon looked at the picture and said, “That’s your grandmother.  That’s my mom.”  </p>

<p>Brooklyn squinted her eyes and cocked her head to the side in an attitude of confusion.  She did not understand.  Her grandma was in Wisconsin and didn’t look anything like this lady.  Even young as she was.      
<br> 
<br>“That’s your mom?  Where is she?”  </p>

<p>“She died when I was your age.”  Shannon gave her this new piece of information and waited to see what Brooklyn thought about it.   </p>

<p>“Was it sad?” Brooklyn asked.   </p>

<p>My grandpa had been reaching across the table to deal her a card, his hand stopped in mid air and he looked at Shannon.  My grandmother put her hands on the edge of the sink and watched the dish water drain away.  We had all taken a breath together and held it, waiting to see what my sister was going to say.</p>

<p>I remembered that day in the hospital.  Sitting on my Uncle Leroy’s lap with my Aunt Helen’s face close to mine, her hand on my cheek saying, “It’s ok to cry, Aimee.  You can cry.”  I hadn’t cried but had gotten down and gone to the empty seat by the window to push the venetian blinds back and forth back and forth to hear them clicking because I didn’t want to hear everyone else crying.  </p>

<p>“Why is she telling me to cry?” I thought.  “We’re just in the hospital, we’re waiting for grandpa, he’ll tell me what’s going on when he gets here.”  Eventually, the blinds swung to a stop and when I turned around I saw my grandpa pushing open the door to the waiting room.  My uncle Tim went up to him and shook his head, my grandpa took two steps back and put his hands over his face.  When I heard him crying I knew it wasn’t going to be ok.      </p>

<p>Shannon looked down from the picture and at Brooklyn, “Yeah it was.  It was really sad.”  </p>

<p>Brooklyn looked at her mom and said, “I’m sorry you were sad.”   </p>

<p>My grandpa pulled his arm back and straightened the cards in his hand.  “What do you say we take a break for a minute?”  My grandma took the dishtowel and wiped the sink dry going around and around the basin.   </p>

<p>I pushed my chair away from the table and said to Brooklyn, “You know what? </p>

<p>There’s a really great playground just down the street.  How ‘bout we go play for a little bit?”   </p>

<p>“Yeah,” she said and scrambled to put on her shoes.   </p>

<p>“I’ll take her.”  I told Shannon.  </p>

<p>“Could you?” She asked.  </p>

<p>“Of course.”  </p>

<p>Walking over to the park in the still warmth of the evening, with the loamy smell of the waist high bluestem around us, I told Brooklyn, “This is where your mom and I used to play with our cousins.” </p>

<p>“You did?  Are they coming this weekend?”  She asked.  </p>

<p>“They sure are.  You’re going to meet a lot of people tomorrow.”  </p>

<p>“I can’t wait.”  And she ran ahead of me to the end of the block where she could see the skeletons of the swings and monkey bars.  </p>

<p>This park was where we had played before we moved to Wisconsin.  My father had remarried quickly after my mom died and the entire small town in western Minnesota where we lived disapproved.  It was where they had both lived their entire lives.  </p>

<p>In the grocery store, at his office where he provided insurance for most of the people in the county and at church on Sunday mornings, he could read disappointment in the faces of her best friend, her first boyfriend from grade</p>

<p>school, her eight brothers and sisters and my grandparents.   </p>

<p>Then, when my sister started to look like my mom and I started to act like her, it was too hard on everyone, so we left.  At first we came back for every holiday, then maybe once in the summer and then, by the time I was in high school, not really at all.  By that time my step mom was my mom and talking to my Minnesota relatives was a semantic minefield, no one quite sure who I meant when I said mom.  It became complicated.    
<br> 
<br>The park, though, the park is never complicated.  </p>

<p>Brooklyn and I sat on the swings, went on the merry go round.  She made me climb up the slide and when she fell off the monkey bars and skinned her knee, she didn’t cry.  She came over to me, looked at the blood running down her leg and said, “Uh oh.  I guess we better go home.” </p>

<p>“I think you’re right.  We better go home.”  I kissed her on the top of her head, took her hand and we headed to the sidewalk.  When we were walking back it occurred to me that I was willing to let her be sorry for us being sad, something I normally hated, because she was the only one I had ever heard finish that sentence.  It wasn’t just I’m sorry your mom died.  She had put it together in the way only kids can sometimes and was sorry for the real thing, for the fact that her death had made us sad.  We didn’t have to be sad forever and she was sorry that at one point we were. By the time we got back home, my sister and grandma were on the couch in the living room and my grandpa was already napping in the recliner.   </p>

<p>“Come here, my little peachkin.”  My grandma said and Brooklyn climbed up on the couch between them.   
<br> 
<br>Starting early the next day, everyone gathered.  From just after breakfast until dinner was being served my family came through the door carrying paper bags full of unshucked corn, Tupperwear containers of cookies and one very large smoked fish my uncle Rick had bought but would try to tell us later he had caught.  The screen door slammed behind each addition and the noise in the house grew with every slam.  My cousin Heidi, the tallest of all of us, who just had a baby boy and her husband who I hadn’t met but who I had heard my uncle didn’t really like.  Slam.  Her very slightly shorter sister Heather with her two kids, just having finished her divorce from the guy her dad liked from the beginning. </p>

<p>Slam. My cousin Gerald and his sister Erica who shocked me by having completely grown up into a woman.  Slam.  My godparents Joanie and Craig who greeted me with, “It’s so nice to have you back.”  Slam.  Slam.  Slam.  We gathered and the door hardly seemed to stop. </p>

<p>In the afternoon, my uncles Pat, Tim, Jerry and Ron were out in the garage setting up the extra chairs and tables for dinner and there wasn’t even room in the kitchen if I had wanted to help because my aunts Helen, Debby, Katie and Jody were busy cutting mountains of potatoes, shucking bags of corn on the cob, getting out stacks of dishes and shooing the smaller kids outside so they would stop asking, “When’s dinner going to be ready?”  </p>

<p>Eventually, as the work went on, we all found a place to settle and wait for the smells of the meatloaf and scalloped potatoes to travel down the hall and into the basement.  A poker game had started in the garage and I was in the living room playing Operation with a bunch of the younger kids- the cousins and second cousins I hardly knew but who seemed to know a lot about me.  “You’re Aunt Aimee.  You live in Chicago and only come see us sometimes.  What’s Chicago like?  Why don’t you come home more?”   </p>

<p>We would try to take out the wishbone or the thigh bone and every time one of us ended up touching the little metal outline, making the buzzing noise and stopping the game to laugh because, if you really think about it, that game has no point but to make you laugh at the fact you are screwing it up.  You are not getting the bone out with the little tweezers but you get that noise and the noise is funny.  So we’re laughing, Adam with his summer skin, brown from playing baseball, Amanda next to him with a sour expression on her face, home from college in Boston and now too sophisticated to have fun,  Tracy and Natalie sharing a chair and elbowing each other for position at the table.  We’re all hunched over the red plastic game with our metal tweezers balanced in our fingers, watching as four year old Nick goes in for the funny bone.  Reach…. steady…. almost…. he’s got it…. go Nick!... bzzzzzzzzzzzz and we all howl with laughter, even Amanda, and pinch our tweezers together hoping, not just hoping, knowing that when it is our turn we’ll get the funny bone out with no buzz.  </p>

<p>It was Brooklyn’s turn.  She had very quietly been watching all of us, looking at our technique and analyzing what we were doing wrong.  Brooklyn is not the most competitive kid but for whatever reason she had determined to get that little bone out without a sound.   </p>

<p>Brooklyn took the tweezers from Nick, held them in her hand.  Moved them once to a better grip, bit her lip and looked down at the game.  We were all caught in her concentration and the room went quiet as she dipped the tweezers straight down into that impossibly small opening.  Her hand stopped, she closed her eyes and I saw the muscles in her hand close the tips of the tweezers together. </p>

<p>Together around the table we took a breath as she started to lift her hand up and I pulled my chin into my shoulder, squinted my eyes and gritted my teeth waiting for the sound.  The buzz… </p>

<p>It never came.  With her eyes closed, she lifted that little piece right out of the guy’s elbow and held her arm up as far as it would go so we could all see that she had made it.  There was a collective rising around the table and cheer from everyone, even the cousins who had a minute ago been complaining it was their turn.  We laughed and Brooklyn said over and over, “I got it.  Did you see?  I got it right out!”  </p>

<p>Our noise had brought my uncle Pat to the doorway of the living room from his poker game.  Pat had always been my favorite uncle because he was one of the youngest boys and when I was little and he was home from duty he would pick me up and throw me into the couch for an entire afternoon because it made me laugh.   </p>

<p>Pat looked at me over the heads of his boys, my cousin’s boys and girls, my niece and my nephew.  He said, “You sound like her when you laugh.”</p>

<p>Brooklyn looked up at Pat and asked, “Who?”  </p>

<p>“Both of you. You both sound just like her when you laugh.”  He smiled at me and winked then went back in the other room to finish the poker game.   </p>

<p>Brooklyn still had the funny bone in the tweezers and held it up for me to look at.  “See, it’s really easy.” she said, “You just have to have to lift it right up.” </p>

<p>“I think you’re right,” I said, looking up at the picture of my mom on the now empty hutch and agreed, “I think it might be just like that.” </p>
