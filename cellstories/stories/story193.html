<h2>It Is What It Is</h2>
	<h3>Aimee Perkins</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>I didn’t want to be who I was.  That’s how this all started. </p>

<p>I was a junior in high school and everything about me was wrong. </p>

<p>My favorite look at the time was wearing one of my dad’s old dress shirts over leggings that were smaller than they should have been.  I wore braces late because I had an overbite.  I had an overbite because I sucked my thumb until I was twelve.  Twelve.  Pimples, no makeup, shoes that always kind of smelled because I had sweaty feet and freckles everywhere. </p>

<p>Oh how very eighties this all sounds.  I know.  I wouldn’t feel as bad if it were because everyone looked dumb in the eighties but this was 1992 and the fact it was Wisconsin doesn’t even save it.  There is no excuse, I was a mess and I count it a minor miracle that I sit before you now as a relatively normal adult.</p>

<p>What I wanted to be was Paula Milanowski.   Paula was rich.  She wore things like shearling coats and dark washed Wrangler jeans with cowboy boots and pearls.  Pearls.  She had watched some serious Dallas in her day and it rubbed off.  She was the first of us to get a perm right and the first of us to venture into high heel territory.</p>

<p>And Paula was dating Aaron Powers.  Mmmm…Aaron Powers.  Aaron was like an angel.   The best blonde curly hair that was a little out of control, especially when it got longer.  Blue, blue eyes.  He had skinny legs and ripped jeans and always wore a flannel with a hole in the left elbow. </p>

<p>His locker was right down the hall from mine so I could tell he was perfectly taller than me.  Just tall enough so that if I went up and put my arms around his waist I’d be able to rest my chin on his collarbone and nestle my face into his neck.  I could tell this from down the hall.  Whenever we were at our lockers at the same time, I would imagine him turning to me in the crowded hallway, looking across our rushing classmates and saying, “Perkins, let’s blow this place.”  And then he would grab my hand and we wouldn’t even make it to his car in the parking lot, instead we’d run through the deserted gym into the boys locker room where he would ravish me under the showers until we were interrupted by the football team coming in from practice.  I would be fake-shocked and cover myself quickly with Aaron’s shirt, hiding behind him while he told them all to, “Get outta here.”  And they would all leave without showering, heading to their girlfriend’s houses and part time jobs smelling like practice.</p>

<p>I didn’t want Paula’s money or Aaron’s ridiculous beauty.  I wanted to stand out they way they stood out, these bright and shiny objects separate among the great anonymous mass of the rest of us.  So I sought them out, hoping to learn something more useful from them than I was learning from Mr. Dombrowski. </p>

<p>Our friendship was sudden and intense, as unexpected and thrilling as riding a bike without training wheels.  The week before Halloween, at a football game, as I was putting mustard on my hot dog and Aaron was salting his popcorn aggressively, Paula said, “Let’s go to the mall tomorrow.”</p>

<p>What an exciting development, we had never hung out on a weekend before.  “Ok.” I said and pushed the plunger down on the industrial sized mustard jar so hard it overshot the bun and got all over my jean jacket.  My favorite jean jacket that had a bedazzled picture of Mickey Mouse on the back of it. </p>

<p>Paula took a handful of napkins from the table and rolled her eyes at me.  “I’ll pick you up at 3.” </p>

<p>She walked away and Aaron flicked a piece of popcorn at me.  “Maybe I should come too, Perkins. We can get our noses pierced.”</p>

<p>I said, “Yeah, my parents would love that.” </p>

<p>“Exactly.”  He smiled and turned to follow Paula.</p>

<p>Complete panic set in.  In the mall, on a Saturday, I would be exposed in my lameness.  I had nothing to wear.</p>

<p>I went home and tore through my older sister’s closet ending up with her rayon babydoll dress that had dark red roses all over it and decided to wear it over my black leggings with lace bottoms and used to be white Keds.</p>

<p>Paula picked me up the next day in her Taurus wearing a Lacoste polo shirt and Girbaud jeans.  She looked like she belonged in a catalog, I looked like…well, I looked like me.       </p>

<p>As we were walking through the mall, it seemed like every store was an opportunity for me to improve myself.  We passed Super Cuts and Paula said, “If I were you, I’d totally go with bangs.  They’re really cute and they’ll cover that breakout you always have on your forehead.”  We went in, I sat down and bangs it was.</p>

<p>When we passed the Estee Lauder counter at the JC Penney, Paula happened to know the woman standing behind the counter and asked her, “Can you show her how to line her lips so they don’t look so thin all the time?”  I sat down and forty five minutes later had a new face and didn’t recognize myself in the mirror. </p>

<p>We were sitting on a bench facing Claire’s boutique sipping Orange Juliuses deciding if we were going to the Limited or Maurices next so I could get some new jeans and a better purse when Aaron walked up in his jeans and flannel, sat down next to Paula and took a long drink from her cup.  I wanted to be the straw.  He looked at me and said, “What?”  I had been staring at his hand on her thigh. </p>

<p>“Nothing.”  I said. </p>

<p>“What happened to your face, Perkins?”  he asked.</p>

<p>Paula smiled and said, “She looks better.” </p>

<p>“She told me last night she’d get her nose pierced.”  He winked at me.</p>

<p>Was he flirting with me?  Was I going to get my nose pierced?  Would he think that was hot?  I had just decided I would get my nose pierced if Aaron asked me again when Paula tossed her shiny dark hair over her shoulder in the dramatic style of Sue Ellen Ewing and said, “I’m bored.  Let’s go.” </p>

<p>“Where the hell are we supposed to go?” Aaron asked, picking at the scab on his knee through the frayed hole in his jeans. </p>

<p>“We’re going to my house.  I’ll drive.”  She clip clipped down the hallway in her little leather flats.  Aaron and I followed a couple of steps behind.  I could smell that he had mowed the lawn that day. </p>

<p>Then we were in the parking lot where Paula put the key into the ignition, I was in the passenger seat and Aaron was in the back smoking a cigarette he had stolen from his brother.   Paula drove fast and it seemed to take a long time to get out to her house in the country.  We went up her long, long driveway, passing a field where there were strange long necked animals among the trees. </p>

<p>“What are those?”  I asked</p>

<p>“Llamas.  We raise llamas.  They’re mean but their hair is really valuable.” </p>

<p>When we got up to the house everything was dark.  Even the garage light was out.  “My parents are on vacation.”   </p>

<p>“Why aren’t you, then?”  Aaron asked the rearview mirror through a veil of smoke. </p>

<p>She narrowed her eyes at him and opened the door without waiting for us.  We scrambled out of the car and followed her to the front door.  I stared at the back of Aaron’s head and wanted to wrap my fingers in his curls and kiss him. </p>

<p>Paula walked through the living room to the kitchen without turning the lights on and went out the sliding glass door to the back patio.  There were four lounge chairs out there and a fire pit.  The fire pit was well used because Paula’s parents were fire walkers.  I had never seen them do it but Paula talked about it all the time.   As in, “My mom can totally take ice cold showers now because the firewalking has taught her how to be disinterested in pain.  Take a chair.  Lay down.  We’re going to find our spirit guides.” </p>

<p>Aaron laughed.  “I don’t need a spirit guide.”  But he lay down on the chair next to her anyway.  “Lay the hell down Perkins, you for sure need a spirit guide.” </p>

<p> “Shut up, Aaron.”  I said, glad it was dark because I was blushing like an idiot.  </p>

<p>“My mom did this with me.  You really have to relax and listen to me.  If you commit to it, you will find the animal spirit who will guide you when you are uncertain.” </p>

<p>Well, shit.  I was uncertain all the time. </p>

<p>“You are in a peaceful wood.  Alone in a peaceful wood on a warm and quiet day.” </p>

<p>Our house was surrounded by woods on two sides so I imagined myself walking out our back door and into the woods.  It was warm.  I was having a hard time making it quiet because we lived on a busy street but Paula was moving on.  </p>

<p>“See the trees, hear the birds.” </p>

<p>“Smell the bullshit.”  Aaron added. </p>

<p>Oh God, I can’t concentrate on trying to mimic Paula’s breathing and mimic Aaron’s indifference.</p>

<p>Commit I told myself.  There were no birds.  I couldn’t hear any birds.  Oh god.  Wait, don’t keep going I don’t have any birds.  I thought of the only place I knew there were birds and remembered the wallpaper border in our kitchen.  I imagined tearing them out of the wallpaper and poking them on the lowest branches I could reach. </p>

<p>“In this peaceful wood you are standing in the middle of a clearing waiting for your animal spirit guide to reveal itself.” </p>

<p>Concentrate, I told myself.  I closed my eyes tightly and took a powerful breath to catch up.  Trees.  Birds.  Wind.  Oh, not too much wind.  Those birds aren’t on there so great.  One of my birds fell down and fluttered to the ground.  Sun.  More sun.  Nothing.  There’s nothing there. </p>

<p>I will never be pretty and there was no life in my spiritual wood. </p>

<p>Then it was there…just to my left.  I could hear movement in the underbrush.  It sounded big.  The rustling got louder, then through the trees I saw it.  Him. </p>

<p>Facing me in the clearing, wearing a button down oxford, boxer shorts and tennis socks, my imagined sun reflecting off his RayBans, stood Tom Cruise. </p>

<p>Tom Cruise was my animal spirit guide? Are you kidding me? </p>

<p>I know I wasn’t very good at this but wasn’t it supposed to be a bear or something.  Certainly not a movie star.  I mean, if it is going to be a movie star, can’t it be Christian Slater or someone I’m at least attracted to?   </p>

<p>“No.  I’m done.  You need to take me home.” </p>

<p>“Just relax.  It will come to you if you are open to it.” </p>

<p>“Now, please.” </p>

<p>She sighed like I had asked her to fly me to the moon and said, “Fine.  You’re going to have to give me some gas money.” </p>

<p>Paula told Aaron she’d be back and the two of us walked through the darkened house and got in her car.  Driving home mostly in silence, right before I got out she asked, “Did it work?  Did you see anything?”</p>

<p>“Yeah.  I saw Tom Cruise. “ I pushed open the door, turned back to hand her a five dollar bill for gas. </p>

<p>“Are you serious?  Tom Cruise? “ She started to laugh.  And then continued to laugh so hard and so long she ended up with her arms crossed on the steering wheel, her head resting on them, exhausted from the effort of mocking me.  “Oh, god.  That can’t be right.”</p>

<p>I closed the door and walked up my driveway wishing I hadn’t said anything and believing she had a point, it couldn’t be right.  This couldn’t be right. </p>

<p>That’s where the story actually ends.  The writer in me hates it.  I’d rather give you something more satisfying, some triumphant Breakfast Club moment where I confront her in the lunch room and tell her she’s full of shit to the adulation of my peers and a soaring Cameron Crowe soundtrack.  But that’s not the truth, I never did. </p>

<p>I’ve rewritten this ending a thousand times wanting to tell you that story, wanting the sixteen year old version of myself to see the truth that I let the weight of her influence affect me for years, even after we were no longer friends.</p>

<p>But making it into something that isn’t quite the truth didn’t feel right so, in the end, I’ve decided to just let it be what it is and let that be good enough.</p>
