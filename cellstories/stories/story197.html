<h2>Deltoids</h2>

		</p><p>All his life, Cyril’s been his mummy’s fair-haired boy his brother and sisters spent their childhoods languishing in his shade. According to their mother Cyril was not only wittier than his siblings but more intelligent. At meal times he was permitted to eat twice as much as everybody else, and monopolise the conversation. Not surprisingly, Cyril quickly became overwhelmed by his own importance. Clinically speaking, he suffered from Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Aged fourteen Cyril spent long hours shut up in his room examining his sperm under a microscope. His spermatozoa, he understood, were his genetic emissaries carrying his genes into the next generation, and on into the future. It was only right that he should eventually breed and pass on his superior DNA.</p>

<p>  Decades later when Cyril eventually discovered his ideal woman in the form of a sharp-tongued librarian several years his senior, he went to each of his siblings in turn to inform them of his impending marriage. His bride-to-be, he insisted, was highly desirable, highly intelligent, and highly attractive.  It was therefore a given that any progeny he might have with this woman in the future would be smarter and better-looking than their cousins.</p>

<p>      On his wedding night Cyril pointed out to his bride that while his penis was far from large, it’s purple head and angry demeanour made it a force to be reckoned with. </p>

<p>                         2.</p>

<p>The day after they were married Cyril and Rhonda moved into a cabin on the coast.  It was a great little shack without running water or electricity. In summer snakes crawled down the chimney into the house, mice gnawed on the skirting boards as if they were sea biscuits. Rhonda had never learned to cook she hung salami sausages from hooks on the ceiling in the kitchen. Her new husband was in a state of sexual delirium and barely noticed the monotony of their diet, salty salami for breakfast, lunch and dinner. They were wearing out the bed, fatiguing the springs; semen stained the mattress like an algal bloom. Sex was a new discovery for Cyril, his wife’s body was a delight to him, her cunt was so juicy, he loved her small, poached egg breasts. Her tight little anus was puckered as if in disapproval. It made him angry thinking about all the fucking he’d missed out on over the years. Instead of locking himself away in his bedroom with his microscope, he should have been out humping everything that moved. In particular he regretted the adolescent girls he hadn’t cuddled and kissed, young girls were perfect, they had flawless skin.  </p>

<p>Now that Cyril was a married man with responsibilities it was time for him to start thinking seriously about the future. In particular he needed a steady income. It had been his lifelong ambition to some day study marine biology and farm abalone, he’d already begun drawing up plans to set up a series of cages in the sea less than a hundred metres in front of his house. Preferably he’d grow the much-prized green-lipped variety of abalone. Their black-lipped cousins were hardier, and easier to cultivate, but sold for lower prices on the global market. He spent long hours snorkelling in the ocean checking out its indigenous species. He swam amongst flathead and long-nosed elephant sharks, leatherjackets, stingrays. In the breeding season the stingrays congregated in the shallows in elaborate courtship rituals. He speared scores of the rays every week and left their carcases to rot at the water’s edge. The rays were armed with a poisonous barb on the end of their tails that could pose a threat to the children (all excellent swimmers) he planned to have in the near future. The leatherjackets, also, would have to go. Abalone lacked a thickening agent in their blood the merest nip from a leatherjacket’s razor-sharp teeth would cause a fatal bleed.</p>

<p>  At dusk the newly married couple sat on straight-backed chairs on the veranda of their shack watching the sun set over the sea. No two sunsets were ever the same. Even the snakes slithering in the chimney peered through cracks in the brickwork not wishing to miss the haemorrhagic death of another day. </p>

<p>      As time passed, Cyril began to notice he and Rhonda were not alone. He could hear wallabies rustling in the shrubbery, wild geese dropped out of the sky in pairs to drink from the water hole not far from their cabin. It seemed to Cyril the wallabies and the geese were eating and drinking more than their fair share of the property’s resources. He was annoyed by their proprietorial attitude. He began shooting the geese on the wing, blasting them out of the air. He set a spotlight up on the roof of his four-wheel-drive and culled roos at night. Corpses were piling up everywhere, stingrays, leatherjackets, geese and wallabies.</p>

<p>      By summer’s end, Cyril had at least a couple of hundred abalone cages set up offshore. Every day he’d take his boat out to check on his molluscs. Were they getting enough to eat? Was the food they were eating sufficiently nutritious? Were they growing well? Had predators attacked them in the night, and if so how many shellfish had he lost? It seemed to Cyril his abalone were incomparably beautiful. He loved their tough shells, their slimy feet, the light-sensitive cells that were their eyes. He was certain their green lips twitched in what could only be described as a shellfish smile of recognition each time he leaned his head over the side of the dinghy and stared down at them. </p>

<p>      When his abalone began escaping from their cages Cyril feared his heart would break. When a warm current from the north snaked its way down the east coast and cooked his pets alive he wondered if his life was worth living. When seaweed blocked up his charge’s five star accommodation and suffocated them, he openly wept.  
<br> </p>

<p>                                                                   3.</p>

<p>In middle life Cyril fancied himself as looking a lot like Bill Clinton.  He couldn’t understand why it was that his wife could no longer bear to have sex with him. He decided it was related to the fact that her ovaries had shrivelled up, and she’d stopped being a sexual entity. Post-menopausal females were a species apart. They were hostile and frumpish, and the entire human race crossed the street to avoid contact with them.  However Rhonda still knew a hundred and one monotonous ways of preparing smallgoods, she and Cyril indulged in long and intimate bitching sessions during which they bad-mouthed absolutely everyone and everything in the known universe. Rhonda was a vicious little thing it was her most endearing trait, she was also the mother of his three grown up children. His sons and daughter never tired of telling Cyril he needed to get a life, they nagged their father, “Get over yourself.”  
<br>                                                 4.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly in 1997, Cyril’s dad suffered a dramatic decline in his health.  Cyril’s father began losing weight he complained he mostly felt tired. In autumn he began using a walking stick. In the dead of winter he fell to the ground and was unable to get back up onto his feet again. By the time spring arrived he was bed-ridden, and only barely able to eat or drink. Cyril’s mother was distraught, she stopped combing her hair, or washing her face. She sank into a deep depression. When Cyril’s dad soiled the bedclothes she ranted and raved, he was a dirty old man and should learn to control his bodily functions.</p>

<p>      Cyril’s father had bone cancer he passed away at 4.00am on the 1st of December. Cyril’s mum slept next to his dad’s corpse in the double bed they’d shared all their married life for three days and nights before she allowed his body to be removed from the house.  
<br>His father’s death had been cause for contemplation. Truly a man’s lifetime is short. Unless he happens to be an exceptional abalone farmer, it’s also meaningless. Man is ruled, principally, by his physical needs. He eats, drinks, screws, works his butt off, falls asleep in his armchair in front of the telly at night, and then one day he dies. Just like a road kill he putrefies.</p>

<p>      On the day of his dad’s funeral Cyril found himself remembering how his father had punched him in the head without warning when he was sixteen years old, dropping him to his knees. He’d resented the fact that Cyril was already taller than he was, and a threat to his ego. 
<br>                                          5.</p>

<p>Shortly after his sixtieth birthday Cyril took up weightlifting. His biceps and his triceps, quads and pecks, deltoids and hamstrings seemed to pump up over night. He felt like a new man, he was filled with optimism. He began offering to give adolescent girls in the neighbourhood driving lessons. They giggled and squeaked as he fumbled the gear stick, and grabbed at their thighs. He was such a bastard, they told each other, a prick. His wife, hearing rumours, filled his salami sausage with cayenne pepper, and her outrage. His kids, now adults and living away from home, e-mailed him, “Grow up, Dad.” </p>
