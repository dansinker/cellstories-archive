<h2>Notes on Los Cerritos</h2>
	<h3>David Miller</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p><h4>1.</h4></p><p>Like anyone truly grounded in his or her place, Pablo (not his real name) never spoke about himself, never talked about Los Cerritos. Conversations were always about the waves that day, parties from the night before, or people—new surfers or women—who’d set up camp. He never let on to his own story, except for the briefest hint dropped one evening as he watched the waves reel off the point.               </p>

<p><i>“Surfiar ha abierto una puerta para vivir,”</i> he said. Surfing has opened the door to life.
<br>             
<br><h4>2.</h4></p><p>At the time it was hard not to laugh. Pablo stood there in his red poncho, his dark eyes squinting through the sunset. All that seemed missing from his monologue, with its utter pride and histrionics, was a raised fist, or a band of Mariachis backing him up on strings and horns. But looking back on it now, perhaps with less illusions than I had at the time, (or perhaps more), I see that what he wasn’t saying was the real story.              
<br> 
<br><h4>3.</h4></p><p>Pablo’s hacienda: a sun-cooked Detroit van and a pair of cheap dome tents walled in with Coca-Cola signs and stacks of surfboards. It sat just above the high tide mark. Pablo rented the boards and sold herb. His hacienda was the gathering place for both local Mexicans and travelers alike. The first time I saw him, he was getting high with a local Mexican’s horse. He’d stroke its muzzle, whisper in its ear, and blow smoke into its nostrils. Then, without warning, he mounted the horse, galloped down the beach and back, and started doing tricks.  
<br> 
<br><h4>4.</h4></p><p>My days in Cerritos had a monastic regularity. I’d get up just before dawn, then surf through the morning. Usually by 10, the sun was hot, and onshore winds blew out the waves. Once the cool air and glassy water returned in the evening, I’d paddle back out with Pablo and all the other surfers for the sunset session.
<br> 
<br><h4>5.</h4></p><p>In between I spent a lot of time waiting. I’d read, write, fish, or swim. Some days hitched into Todos Santos to check emails or buy groceries. But maybe the best times were spent in the narrow rectangle of shade under Pablo’s metal-sign roof, where I slowly began to decipher the local Mexican slang. As far as I could understand, anything good was masculine, <i>Padre</i>. Anything weak or bad was feminine, <i>Madre</i>. And <i>cabron</i>, or bastard, was a ubiquitous term of endearment. But for all this machismo, almost seeming to border on misogyny, any female aged 15 to 55 who passed in front of the hacienda would cause an immediate transformation in Pablo and the rest of the Mexican kids. All conversation ceased, and they’d sit up like polite suitors, each trying to outdo the other with compliments on the woman’s beauty, especially if she was a gringa, and most of all if she was <i>huera</i>, blonde.
<br>             
<br><h4>6.</h4></p><p>
<br>And yet, somehow this behavior seemed less for the woman’s benefit and more a way for the kids to try and prove to each other that they weren’t gay.
<br> 
<br><h4>7.</h4></p><p>The only other traveler who was a regular at Pablo’s was a 16-year old French Canadian girl named Dominique. She was tall and thin, with a perpetually peeling nose, and blond hair that matched the delicate tufts growing from her armpits. Her family had been driving their van down to Cerritos for years. Dominique spoke fluent Spanish with a French accent, and I got the feeling that the Mexican kids were both fascinated by and afraid of her.
<br> 
<br><h4>8.</h4></p><p>One day Dominique and I sat at Pablo’s along with a kid from Ensenada named Julio, and his sister, Amapola. Littering the sand were crumpled beer cans and paper plates turned waxy with grease. The ubiquitous <i>40 Ounces to Freedom</i> by Sublime, or Sube-lee-may, as the Mexicans called it, was running through yet another rotation on the battered tape player.                </p>

<p>“<i>¿Un Gallo?</i>” Julio whined. “<i>¿Where’s the gallo?</i>”
<br>             
<br>Everyone laughed. Several thick <i>gallos</i> (roosters), or joints, had already been passed that morning.
<br>             
<br>“If nobody has a gallo we could look for Pitaya flowers,” Pablo said.
<br> 
<br>“<i>¿Flores de Pitaya?</i>” I asked. “What’s that?”
<br>              
<br>“They grow on the cacti up there,” Pablo said, nodding to the desert hills and headlands—the Cerritos—rising up from the beach. “You smoke them.”
<br>             
<br><h4>9.</h4></p><p>We walked across the beach in the grinding midday sun, stepped through a hot, shallow estuary, then climbed the steep headland. Looking down at the ocean, you could study how the point deflected waves in various sections. Two hundred yards out, they broke large and foamy. Closer to the beach were inside sections that broke hollow and fast over the shallow sand floor. 
<br> 
<br><h4>10.</h4></p><p>I stopped to drink some water. Dominique, Amapola, and Julio were several yards below, moving slow in the heat. Pablo waited a few yards up, standing beside a Pitaya cactus. Instead of growing tall like a Saguaro, the Pitaya grew long tangles with spiny arms that spread horizontal to the ground. Often there were several dead arms still attached to the cactus, its green skin burned away, leaving a chalky skeleton full of holes where the spines once grew.
<br> 
<br><h4>11.</h4></p><p>“Ok,” said Pablo, as if we were huddled up before a play. “This is it. The flowers only bloom after it rains. Then they dry up and fall off. They look like twisted cigars and they’re hard to see because they’re the same color as the ground.”</p>

<p>We fanned out and slowly moved up the hill, bending to examine each Pitaya. I looked and didn’t see anything. My shoulders were burning.
<br> 
<br>“<i>Abajo, Abajo</i>,” Pablo shouted from above. “Make sure you look <i>underneath</i>.”
<br>             
<br><h4>12.</h4></p><p>A few minutes later Amapola yelled “<i>mira</i>” and held something up. It did look like a small cigar, only grey and twisted, with shriveled petals dried a deep burgundy.
<br>              
<br>“Sí,” Pablo smiled.
<br>             
<br>As we climbed to the top, each of us found a couple more. Then we sat in a tight circle in the half-shade of a giant saguaro. Pablo took a small pitaya and broke off the tip, leaving only a hollow stem ending in a bundle of petals.</p>

<p>“Cuidado,” he warned. “The end has little spines.”
<br>             
<br>We watched silently as Pablo put the flower in his mouth then lit the petals, which burned in a perfect glowing cherry. He puffed several times, exhaling theatrically, then passed it along and lit another.
<br> 
<br><h4>13.</h4></p><p>When I took the first puff I felt nothing. But the smoke was strangely cool and aromatic. I looked around to see if anyone else was noticing anything, but everybody was just puffing away on the flowers as if they were cigarettes.
<br>              
<br>We kept smoking for several minutes. The waves broke noiselessly far below. To the east was the piñon-carpeted sierra. I’d asked some of the older locals in Todos Santos about climbing them. They’d told me you could find water up there, springs, and that there were deer. But none of the young locals or surfers I’d talked to had ever been up there.
<br> 
<br><h4>14.</h4></p><p>After a while I noticed something strange: I was no longer hot. It almost felt as if I’d put on a damp t-shirt and as the wind blew through it I felt cool. The desert valley—something that had always seemed more of wasteland than something alive—suddenly seemed almost friendly. It was as if after three trips to Baja I was actually seeing the desert for the first time.
<br> 
<br><h4>15.</h4></p><p>The Pitaya flowers: who figured out that you could smoke them? What forces led them to try? I thought about other plants. Their effects were always interrelated to the terrain from which they grew. Quinoa, for example, which thrives at high elevations, is common used to treat altitude sickness. Even something as simple as poison ivy has certain logic: it often grows in disturbed areas as if warning people to stay out and let the area heal. </p>

<p>These examples—the first that came to mind—were among hundreds of cases that could be explained scientifically, but pointed more towards a folk knowledge that has lived and died with native peoples for how many years?  
<br> 
<br><h4>16.</h4></p><p>Pablo and Julio said they were going surfing and started jogging down the slope, followed by Dominique. Amapola stepped timidly around the cacti and rocks. I walked with her. Halfway down, just as the hill tabled out into the point, we stopped and took in the view.
<br>             
<br>“What’s it like in Ensenada?” I asked.
<br>             
<br>“It’s very beautiful,” she said, “But it’s gotten so crowded since I was a girl. <i>¿Y tu? ¿De donde estas?</i>”
<br>             
<br>“Georgia,” I told her. “The south. But it’s the same story.”
<br> 
<br><h4>17.</h4></p><p>The wind filtered through her hair and pulled her sarong around her thin frame and I wondered if the way she looked at me meant she wanted to be kissed. But we just walked back down to the beach together as if we were already lovers, or maybe brother and sister, anything but two travelers who had just met, smoked <i>Flores de Pitaya</i> on top of the hills, and probably wouldn’t see each other again.</p>
