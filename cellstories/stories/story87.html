<h2>I Dunno</h2>
	<h3>D Jason Cooper </h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>This was in the days when Ed Don George was running the Buffalo territory, before Pedro took over. He was good to the boys, like when he told what was called Negro wrestlers in those days, “I don't give your people a discount when they buy tickets, I'm not gonna give you a discount when I pay your wages.” Ed Don was like that, he thought deep about things and he had strategy in his head. Guess he needed that kind of thinking when he was  the world wrestling champion. But even he got some trouble, like with Joe Killer Christie.</p>

<p>      Killer Joe was as nice a guy as you'd care to meet. He was the kind of guy who'd give you the shirt off his back on a really cold day, so long as you were out of the ring.  In the ring he was a stiff bastard who angered fans so much he sometimes had to hide under the hood of the Masked Marvel to keep from being stabbed.</p>

<p>      It's the night of the card, meaning the show, and Killer Joe came in late, which was a touchy point with Ed Don.  Killer Joe just came in by the back door of the Old Armory, which opened onto a locker room where all the wrestlers were getting ready.</p>

<p>      “You're late,” growled Ed Don.</p>

<p>      “You're right,” said Joe, not fussed at all.</p>

<p>      Then Ed Don looked at what Killer Joe is carrying, a Klan hood. Everybody stopped getting ready and stared at it.  Some guys sitting on the benches were standing up to get a better look.</p>

<p>      “Where'd you get that?”</p>

<p>      Killer Joe just shrugged his shoulders. “I dunno,” he said, “some guy I beat up.”</p>

<p>      He dropped the hood on a bench and went to get ready for his match that night. Ed Don looked at it, then he lifted that front flap that had the eye holes.  On the inside was a big wad of snot, blood, and what looked like cartilage.  Ed Don dropped the hood and moaned.</p>

<p>      “What is it with you, Joe?  I should make you lose this match to teach you a lesson in respect.”</p>

<p>      “I should remind you the other guy was already going to win and teach you a lesson in booking.  If you can't remember who's going to win a match you might as well make it a shoot.”</p>

<p>      Killer Joe was threatening to ignore Ed Don's orders and beat the snot out of whatever wrestler he was facing.  Since it was Killer Joe, it was pretty likely he'd win.</p>

<p>      One of the office staff came in.  It seems one of the city fire inspectors had found a problem only Ed Don George could handle. Turned out the fire inspector had a problem with the dressing room being next to the fire doors. The guys were getting dressed in the room with two large metal doors used to being in equipment and had a fire hose and hydrant inside the building. Why that was a fire hazard is anybody's guess, but fifty bucks made the problem go away like every other week Ed Don had a show.</p>

<p>      Ed Don went off to do some other stuff and he left behind a quiet dressing room. It took Dick the Bruiser to break the quiet.</p>

<p>      “I've had a thousand scraps and he's never said a word.”</p>

<p>      “A drunk in a bar – even a bunch of drunks in a bar – he don't care about.  All they'll do is go away and lick their wounds.  These guys are organized.  Joe might as well have clobbered a cop, a communist, or a Mason.”</p>

<p>      “Or a nun.  They're organized, too.”</p>

<p>      Just then Ed Don came back in.</p>

<p>      “Why'd you have to pick a fight with that guy in the first place, Joe?  If they drive people away form here, they win.  The gate's already down and you guys are being paid less because of it.”</p>

<p>      “He picked a fight with me.”</p>

<p>      “So you hit him?”</p>

<p>      “I was being a good Catholic.”</p>

<p>      There was laughter among the boys.  Nothing says you're losing control over people faster than them laughing in front of you at a joke that's at your expense.</p>

<p>      “So what did he say?”</p>

<p>      “He said that as I was Joe Killer Christie and he was Killer Kowalski we had to be homosexuals banging each other and then he said something about Negroes.”</p>

<p>      “What?”  Then Ed Don George got it.  The match between Killer Kowalski and Bobo Brazil happened in Washington not long before this. It was a one hour draw and the men embraced afterwards because it was the first sanctioned match between a white guy and a black guy. In fact Ed Don had a match that night between a black guy and a white guy. Ed Don got the message that the Klan was spoiling for a fight.  It didn't matter what Joe'd said.  So he stopped worrying about the situation and started thinking about it strategically.</p>

<p>      “Ed Don...”</p>

<p>      “Shut up, Joe. And that goes for the rest of you, don't say anything.  Now, Bruiser, you remember when you were playing football and those fans came at you with the bats? You think you can do that trick again?”</p>

<p>      Dick the Bruiser just smiled. There was nothing he liked better than a good fight. Or a bad one. Ed Don then looked over the other boys.</p>

<p>      “We need to work together on this, and everybody's going to have to do as they're supposed to. Do as I tell you without question. They will outnumber us, they will have weapons. But we're wrestlers and they're a bunch of jerks in dresses made outta bed sheets.”</p>

<p>      He had them break out the fire hose and get as many buckets as they could.  They filled the buckets to the brim, and they gave a bucket to each man.  If the guys were wondering by now if Ed Don had kinda lost his marbles, they didn't let on.</p>

<p>       There came a pounding at the back door, and somebody called to open up or they'll break the door down. Fat chance, those were metal fire doors.  You'd need a battering ram to get through. But it was a matter of being careful what you wish for.</p>

<p>      At Ed Don's signal, the two metal doors swung wide open. There was this big bunch of guys in Klan uniforms, the full dress and the hood except for a guy with a bloody face and a flat nose. Lots of those guys had pipes and other weapons. But they just stood there like they didn't expect the doors to open so soon.</p>

<p>      The hose got turned on the lot of them and wrestlers began throwing buckets of water on them as well.  Wrestlers are athletes, meaning they're fit. The water soaked the Klan to the skin. With all that water those costumes got real heavy and they clung to the guys wearing them. Nobody can move fast when they're that weighed down.  Ed Don turned off the water and called up the Bruiser.</p>

<p>      Dick the Bruiser found the one he wanted, a guy with a length of pipe as a club.  He punched the guy, landing his knuckles right on the guy's fingers between the second and the third joints. The guy's hand broke and Dick just said 'thank you very much' for the pipe and started laying into any hand that was carrying a pipe, an ax, a bat, or any kind of weapon.</p>

<p>      The boys followed the Bruiser. They moved in and took that bunch apart.  Killer Joe was in it, just picking people up and slamming them on the ground.  After all, they didn't know the right way to take a bump and most of them landed on their elbows. On bricks, that makes for broken bones. Other boys were punching, stomping, kicking, and ramming Klan heads into the ground.  It took less than a minute for Klan guys to start running, those that could still walk. Funny thing is, the Klan may have got a membership in Pennsylvania, they never did get much of a foothold in Buffalo.</p>
