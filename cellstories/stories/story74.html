<h2>Musicians at a Funeral</h2>
	<h3>Brian Costello</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>These musicians attend funerals wearing the only decent suits and dresses they own—and these are ill-fitting and rumpled, redolent of stoner mothballs. Thoughtless, hasty Salvation Army purchases on the morning of some wedding, now worn to make the effort, to cover tattoo sleeves, to soak the hungover sweat of last night’s funereal binge, to show their dead drummer friend’s parents their son’s friends were alright, even if they look a little goofy.</p>

<p><h4>*</h4></p><p>In the 1985 Chevy Vanagon, ten musicians from four bands cram inside the dirty blue interior. The only bass player of the ten, the last to be picked up, sits on the van’s floor between the two middle seats and the back bench. Unable to see out the sides, unable to see much over the dashboard, Division Street before the on-ramp to the highway is nothing but streetlight and potholes. </p>

<p>      Conversation, even if they wanted it, is impossible where he sits. The Vanagon’s speakers only work in the back. They’re turned up loud enough for the husband and wife guitar team in the front—navigating and driving respectively--to hear the live Velvet Underground fifteen minute version of “What Goes On.” The swirling jangly calliope repetition provides a needed ballast while silently confronting the unanswerable “Why?”</p>

<p>      Naturally, the two drummers on either side of the only bass player tap the rhythm in cheap, beat-to-hell gym shoes. Drummers, [annoyed, resigned sigh]. Even en route to funerals, they compulsively tap and pound, wearing the only shoes they own.</p>

<p>      Driving away from the city’s perpetual glow, into the black of an early spring evening, they move closer to the far northwestern suburb where the funeral will be held. The only bass player in the van feels like he’s riding in a rock and roll space capsule. Of course, everyone here knows the deceased drummer died in a van like this, in darkness like this, somewhere in the touring hinterlands between Minneapolis and Seattle. This album, “Velvet Underground: Live, 1969,” was known by everyone in the van to be one of his favorites.</p>

<p><h4>*</h4></p><p>In the parking lot of the funeral home, the musicians in the van join other musicians in vans. The streets surrounding the funeral home are quiet; all the businesses of the self-consciously quaint preserved Midwestern downtown hometown smalltown of the deceased drummer are closed until morning. Inside these cheap suits are hip flasks of whiskey, passed between fifteen different bands. Embraces are far different from the usual last-call camaraderie. The shocked awareness of how fleeting this is, we are. This delusion we will be around forever, that we’re anything more than billions of renters, milling about the place like we own it.</p>

<p>      “How are you?” is said between them out of habit, and the question carries more weight. No one knows how to answer properly.</p>

<p>      By the entrance to the funeral home, family enter. The musicians cap the flasks, toss their smokes, close the van doors, trudge across the parking lot, numbed by the sad enormity of loss.</p>

<p><h4>*</h4></p><p>In front of the baby blue closed casket, the deceased drummer’s parents stand behind a podium. The family and the closest of friends sit in folding chairs, arranged in neat rows. The musicians stand around the perimeter of the three walls facing the casket. The family is mostly comprised of the old, older, and young, younger. The musicians are somewhere in between. Post-collegiate, but not like the paunchy middle-aged men and women, dressed more conventionally, appropriately.</p>

<p>      The deceased’s mother and father are divorced, but stand together. “We’re here,” the Dad, who looks like a Dad—his Dad—begins, “to…celebrate, the life of our son. Many of you knew him well…we knew him well....of course…but if any of you have stories you would like to share of our son, of your friend, please share. We would love to hear them, to know who he was.”</p>

<p>      “Please,” the Mom, who looks like a Mom—his Mom—adds.</p>

<p>      The family stories revolve around baseball, music, moving, friends, girlfriends. His closest musician friends talk of tours, of his love of music.</p>

<p>      The bass player wants to say so much, but doesn’t want to say a thing. What stabs him, besides the loss, is the regret. Never had the chance to say, “Hey, I like you.” The friendship requests over the years, from Friendster, to MySpace, to Facebook, to Twitter, did not do it justice. So many chances, before the shows, at the shows, after the shows, the parties, after the parties…none were taken. Was it enough to drink, goof off, watch the bands, play records, dance, laugh?</p>

<p>      “Who’s next?” His father asks from the podium.</p>

<p>      The only bass player from the rock and roll space capsule van imagines himself stepping up to the podium, clearing his throat, speaking: “I remember the time he joined in a ketchup fight at some Milwaukee basement show. While the bands played, kids squirted red plastic bottles of ketchup, or flung the contents of glass Heinz bottles. Some just flat-out threw the Heinz bottles into the walls. Inevitably, the concrete floor was a mess of ketchup and broken glass. He slipped, and a piece of glass cut deep into his hand, and blood mixed into this already messy mixture. He went to the hospital, and made it through ok, obviously, but the jokes, later! The imagined burial at the cemetery, as his casket is lowered, and everybody pours ketchup on the ground for their dead homie, but since it’s ketchup, nothing comes out, and one person bumps the bottom of the bottle, and another taps the “57” on the bottle, and another takes a kitchen knife, rattling it around, flinging the ketchup off the knife. I guess what everybody needs to know here about him is that he was the one laughing the hardest at these jokes. Somebody once nicknamed him “The Farting Prankster,” because that’s who he was, and this sweet, wild humor, that he brought to music and to life, is what I will miss and what the world misses already.”</p>

<p><h4>*</h4></p><p>Seeing musicians cry is like seeing anybody else cry who you never thought you’d see cry because you were too busy having too much fun to consider you may one day see your friends in tears.</p>

<p><h4>*</h4></p><p>The bass player retakes his seat in the rock and roll outer space capsule of a van for the return ride home. No music. No talking. The bass player thinks about what he used to think about death—that when it was over, there would be ticker tape parades, wailing, dramatic sadness, profound speeches, erected statues, and much fuss. Then, a little older, believing that death wouldn’t be that much different than his move from his 3rd floor division street apartment he had lived in for a number of years. Like you think the street and its inhabitants will all give a warm fond send-off, waving hankies and bon voyage streamers, tearful cheering, but when he carried the last box and put it into the moving van, all he saw was a woman bending over in front of the liquor store across the street picking up her llasa apsa’s droppings with the Chicago Tribune editorial page, throwing it into a nearby garbage can while a nearby schizophrenic dance-walked in circles, twitching his arms as he says “Jeeeeee-zus! Jeeeeeee-zus!” at random intervals, adding, “Rrrrrabit! Rabbit food!” Joggers jog. Busses bus. Strangers sit in outdoor restaurants, disinterestedly observing this ceaseless routine. Now, in the van, he thinks it’s somewhere in between.</p>

<p><h4>*</h4></p><p>“Who farted?” the wife guitarist yells and moans behind the steering wheel. The bass player sees her head peak up in the rear view mirror. It all happens so fast—furtive inhalations, followed by gasps, followed by more furtive inhalations, curses, gasps, groans, windows rolled down, laughter. Musicians in vans? They fart. It’s expected. It’s how it is. On tour. Riding to local gigs.</p>

<p>      “Oh God! Oh God! Who did that?!” one of the drummers yells. “It smells like…” and everyone knows he wants to say “death,” but, instead, they laugh, because it’s the kind of joke he would have loved. Awful puns. Hilarious to him, in their awfulness.</p>

<p>      The bass player smiles. He knows the drummer would have appreciated it. He was notorious for stinking up vans, from coast to coast, across Europe. The bass player shivers from the cold air rattling in the empty highway, happy to have friends. Closer to the city, they pass around their hip flasks, living, slightly happier, hanging on.  </p>
