<h2>The Bullets Were Losing</h2>
	<h3>Chris “C.T.” Terry</h3>

		</p><p>The father and his daughter, Kelly, had a tough time getting the velvety blue foldout couch into the moving truck. Dreading carrying it, they’d saved it for last, then had to maneuver it to the top of a row of boxes. Kelly was fifteen, and as she stood in the street, pushing the bottom of the couch up into the van while her father pulled, she realized that this was the first time her father had looked old to her.  </p>

<p>      Dad was in his early forties. He’d skipped shaving that day, and had sweated through his ratty white undershirt. His stubble and the shadow of the roof of the van gave a ghostly quality to the furious strain on his face. Kelly was glad that Mom was inside. The sweat pouring off of Dad would worry her.</p>

<p>      Mom was going to drive the family car to their new home, one hundred miles across Maryland, while Kelly and her father took the moving truck.</p>

<p>      One hundred miles is a quick drive, but it’s about thirty high schools away – a universe when you don’t have your driver’s license, and you’re leaving the only house you’ve ever lived in.</p>

<p>      “I’ll get my license in April, then I’ll be back here every weekend,” Kelly thought. But April was nine months away, and her mother had kept telling her that she’d meet new people and that her old friends would “slip away.” When Mom said that, Kelly imagined herself standing on a raft that’d been unmoored, drifting to the middle of a lake while her friends stood in a line on the sandy shore. Lisa, Thick Nick, Alexis, Tiffany, Keith…all getting smaller. She didn’t believe her mom. 
<br>      
<br>They sat in the front seat of the truck, looking down on their street while the engine grumbled and the father adjusted the a/c vents. He waved the palm of his hand in front of the openings, waiting for the cold air to blow in. Kelly’s arm crossed under her father’s on the way to the radio knob, but Dad swatted it away.</p>

<p>      “Not yet. I need to figure this thing out.”</p>

<p>      She flopped back onto the pillow that her Mom had left for her. The pillowcase had a pink background with tufts of grass and thumb-tall pictures of Strawberry Shortcake. The design was beginning to fade. She’d had that pillowcase and the matching sheets for as long as she could remember. She looked out the window at the house. Soon it would be her old house. She hated that her mother was still in there, where she wanted to be. If she could be in there alone, she’d sit on the floor in her bedroom and shut her eyes, smelling the leftover smells and hoping that when she looked again, all of her things would be back in order. She reached out her pointer finger and began to chip away at the edge of a decal on the glove compartment that said, “Leave the truck clean. Violators subject to up to $200 in penalties.”</p>

<p>      “Cut that out!”</p>

<p>      Dad was really concerned with getting back the deposit he’d had to put down. Kelly tucked her hand between the door and her seat, then looked around the white metal interior of the truck, gleaming in the late morning sun. It looked like they were riding inside a refrigerator.</p>

<p>      The truck clunked into gear and bit-by-bit, it began to roll into the narrow street. Dad eased on the gas, feeling just much pick-up the engine had. Kelly crouched down in her seat and squinted into the passenger-side mirror, prolonging her last look at the house.  </p>

<p>      Once on the highway, the a/c kicked in and dried off the sweat that had collected behind Kelly’s knees. One of the vents was blowing into her face, and she moved it, scared that any disturbance to her eyes would make her start crying. She didn’t want to cry in front of her father, in a place where he couldn’t leave the room.</p>

<p>      Dad was holding the steering wheel like it was about to fly away, and grimacing down the road. The speedometer hovered between forty-five and fifty miles per hour. Kelly looked at the radio and wondered if the signal for Z94 would reach their new town. She reached up to turn on the radio and hesitated, then moved her hand to the dash, ran a finger over the decal and asked, “Hey Dad? Tell me about when we got the blue couch.”</p>

<p>      Dad tensed when she started to speak, scared to take his attention away from the highway ahead, then rolled his shoulders, first flexing the left, then the right, remembering carrying the couch to the moving truck less than an hour earlier. </p>

<p>      “It was January of 1997, so you were almost four. Mom was out with the Silkens at swing-dancing class, but I’d stayed home because I was sick. I had a fever and a really bad sore throat. I was in the den, watching the Bullets game, and you were asleep in your room upstairs.”</p>

<p>      Kelly felt a funny confusion. All at once, she tried to process the humor in the idea of her parents swing-dancing, what she remembered of their old den — with its wood-paneled walls and door from the TV section to the toy room — and the mention of her bedroom. What was now her old bedroom.</p>

<p>      “That den had…wack insulation, so I kept turning up the heat. I just couldn’t get warm, because I was sick, you know?”</p>

<p>      Dad was one of those guys who rarely got sick, but got floored when he caught the flu every few years. Kelly chuckled through her nose, a little blast, amused by her father’s attempt to use her slang. Then she wondered who Mom danced with at swing-dancing class if Dad wasn’t there.</p>

<p>      “I had the heat all the way up to eighty and my throat started to hurt even more, so I just knew that I needed some vanilla bean ice cream. First, I went to check on you, then I went to the kitchen for the ice cream.”</p>

<p>      Kelly thought of the short, brown plastic bowls that her family had used for cereal and ice cream. Milk or melted ice cream at the bottom looked like the juice in a coconut half. She pictured her father, more than ten years ago, before his ginger hair had started to fade and recede, wearing a bathrobe and scooping curls of the hard ice cream from the carton to the bowl while she slept upstairs.</p>

<p>      She’d been a fat baby, so she hated sharing old pictures of herself with friends. But that chub had started to harden into muscle when she was in second grade and now she was athletic, even tomboyish when she pulled her hair back. She slipped a fingernail under the corner of the decal on the dash and started to work it free.</p>

<p>      “When I brought my ice cream to the backroom, something didn’t seem right as soon as I got there. I could smell smoke, but not like the smoke from the Silkens' chimney — it smelled plasticky. Remember when your mom left the spatula in the pot of sauce?”</p>

<p>      “Yeah,” answered Kelly, jerking her hand from the decal. Black smoke had filled the kitchen, and for dinner, they’d sat on the patio, where it didn’t smell, and eaten Pizza Hut instead of Mom’s famous pasta. Mom had kept joking about how the Pizza Hut was almost the same thing because it had lots of tomato sauce. That was the first time that Kelly had wanted her mom’s cooking instead of the treat of take-out food.</p>

<p>      Dad continued, “Well, it smelled kinda like that. And when I opened the door from your playroom to the TV room, the smell got really bad. Then I walked to the thermostat to see the temperature, and there was smoke coming out of the wall!”</p>

<p>      Kelly mumbled “smoke coming out of the wall” along with her father. She loved this part of the story.</p>

<p>      “So, what did you do, Dad?”</p>

<p>      It was near noon and the sun was directly above the truck. Rush hour was long over, and there were a few other trucks on the highway with them. Dad puttered along in the right lane, still just shy of the speed limit.</p>

<p>      “I dropped my ice cream on the floor!”</p>

<p>      Kelly laughed.</p>

<p>      “Then I ran to the phone in the kitchen and called 911. While I was waiting for the firetrucks to come, I walked halfway up the stairs. That way, if the smoke started coming up from the back of the house, I could get you out. But I didn’t want to wake you up.”</p>

<p>      Kelly still had trouble sleeping at night. Her parents both said that she was impossible to get to bed when she was a baby.</p>

<p>      “How long did the firetrucks take to come?”</p>

<p>      “Not even five minutes. But it felt like an hour. I just stood on the stairs, sniffing,” he snuffled at the air, “then I couldn’t tell if the smell was still in my nose from before or if it was coming upstairs, so I had to tiptoe down the steps, reaching over the creaky ones—”</p>

<p>      Kelly knew that the fourth, six and seventh stairs all creaked. If you stepped lightly, and kept your foot to the side near the banister, they’d keep quiet. She had practiced sometimes during the day, in case Thick Nick and Kelly wanted to sneak out at night. They’d never had the chance.</p>

<p>      “—and go back to the den to check on the smoke. It had got worse, and as I was running through the kitchen to go back to the stairs, the firetrucks came.”</p>

<p>      “How many were there, Dad?”</p>

<p>      “Three. One in the driveway, one up on the sidewalk and almost on our lawn, and one in front of the Silkens’. The next day, Donald Silken told me that he woke up and thought that his house was on fire. </p>

<p>      So, the firemen came in and I pointed them to the backroom, which was getting really smoky, but there still weren’t any flames, and I’ll never forget — one of the firemen, in his big black and yellow rubber suit clomped over to the thermostat and turned the dial down. And he had one of those whiny Maryland accents and he just looked at me and said, ‘You’ve gotta turn the heat off, buddy.’</p>

<p>      Then I looked at the TV, and you could see the bits of blue light reflecting off of the smoke in the air, and the score was up, and the goddamn Bullets were losing!”</p>

<p>      The turn signal clicked as Dad slowed way down and lead the truck off the highway. Tall trees lined the off-ramp and there was a stop sign at the end instead of a light. Kelly looked around for the McDonald’s or the 7-11 or the gas station, and didn’t see anything. Just more trees, and an abandoned one-story house on the lot by the on-ramp across the road. Kelly didn’t know what to make of her new town because there wasn’t much of a town there.</p>

<p>      “Was I still sleeping then, Dad?”</p>

<p>      “Goodness, no! The firemen came in with hoses and I heard you crying and ran out of the backroom. And there you were in the kitchen with this big firefighter guy holding your hand and you were crying your eyes out. It sounded like a siren!</p>

<p>      I picked you up and we waited outside. And I was in my bathrobe and slippers and you had on your pajamas, and we stood on the front lawn. I remember I could see these firemen running around in our house while we weren’t in it, and I was so glad I was out there with you. And then Mom came home.”</p>

<p>      “Oh God.”</p>

<p>      “Yeah. And she told me I wasn’t allowed to eat vanilla bean ice cream anymore, if that’s the kind of thing that would happen.”</p>

<p>      Kelly and her Dad laughed.</p>

<p>      “But the couch, Dad.”</p>

<p>      “Oh. We had a tweed one that got all smoke-damaged that night, so we gave it to the Silkens for their beach house. You cried a lot when Donald came to put it in his car, but you liked the blue one a lot when it folded out because it meant that Grandma and Grandpa could come visit.”</p>

<p>      The truck moved down a two-lane highway with gray asphalt crumbling onto the shoulders. High trees lined both sides of the road.</p>

<p>      “Did I go back to bed after the fire?”</p>

<p>      “Well, we stayed in the Silkens’ guest room that night. All three of us on one bed. But none of us could go to sleep. I kept smelling the smoke in my nose and hair, even after I took a shower. And Mom sat up with you and you kept looking out the window at our house, asking if it was going to catch on fire again.”</p>

<p>      Dad maneuvered the truck up to a brown ranch house, and there was a crunch of gravel on their new driveway. While her father was occupied with parking the truck, Kelly pulled the last of the decal free, feeling the adhesive back stick to her fingertips. She rolled it up and put it in the pocket of her shorts. The truck groaned off and Kelly and her father hopped down from the high seats, then stood on the lawn to wait for Mom. </p>
