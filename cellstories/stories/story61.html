<h2>Iowa: A Love Story</h2>
	<h3>Mike Ingram</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p> This was all because of a girl I met on a sixth-floor fire escape during a particularly tedious East Village party. I was smoking a cigarette and dreaming up excuses to leave early.</p>

<p>      “Doesn’t it sound completely majestic?” she said. “I mean doesn’t it?” Her name was Chelcie. She had these Kewpie-doll eyes I found a little distressing, and hair dyed electric pink. Actually I liked the hair.</p>

<p>      “So,” I said. “I’ll probably need overalls, right? Maybe a tractor?” I didn’t see any harm in playing along.</p>

<p>      Chelcie frowned at me. “Do you think this is some kind of a joke?” she said.</p>

<p>      “Of course not,” I said. “Iowa. Totally. Let’s do it.” I wanted nothing more at that moment than the inside of my cramped apartment, many subway stops away. Lately I’d taken to shutting off the lights, burying myself under the covers and watching old sitcom reruns through rabbit-ear fuzz, shows I hadn’t even liked the first time around: <i>Wings, Roseanne, A Different World</i>.</p>

<p>      Chelcie pulled something from the back pocket of her corduroy skirt. “Here,” she said. “I don’t want to sell you on false promises.”</p>

<p>      The postcard was faded in spots, like it had sat for months in the back window of a car. But still: those undulating green-brown hills, the giant sky, a dilapidated barn and beet-red grain silo dotting the landscape like punctuation. Beautiful!</p>

<p>      “When do we leave?” I said.</p>

<p>      She smiled. “First we’ve got to navigate our way out of this godforsaken party.” She took my hand, led me through the open window to the living room. “Excuse us,” she said, pulling me past semi-circles of hipsters in Dickies and ironic tee shirts. “Pardon us. Coming through.” I was beginning to realize I hadn’t been looking for an excuse to ditch this particular party, but an excuse to ditch <i>all</i> these parties, forever. Lately I’d been experiencing the city as a kind of constant, low-level panic attack, like the background buzz of fluorescent lighting. “Excuse us,” Chelcie was saying. “Marty here’s not feeling well. Pardon us. Beep beep!”</p>

<p>      “My name’s Craig,” I said.</p>

<p>      “Details,” she said. “Details.” </p>

<p>      She wasn’t kidding about Iowa. Or maybe she was, at first, and the joke just got carried away. Maybe we were both only waiting for the other to say Uncle. But she came home with me that night, and the next day, Sunday, we stayed in bed, watching bad television and looking up pictures of cornfields on the Internet, cooing over them as if they were something exotic, forbidden. On Monday, instead of going to work at AmeriSolve, I loaded our things into the trunk of a rental, one of those massive American boats that exist only as rentals, and then we were floating out of the city via the Holland Tunnel and into the wilds of New Jersey, Chelcie just as calm as could be in the passenger seat, wearing these ridiculous Jackie O sunglasses and reading a AAA guidebook like a novel. In the sunlight her hair was the color of cotton candy.</p>

<p>      We were well into the craggy hills of Pennsylvania before I asked her what she was running from. I’d wanted to ask since Canal Street -- hell, since the night we’d met -- but I’d been scared to break whatever spell this was.</p>

<p>      She folded the guidebook over her knee. “I’m not like a murderer or something, if that’s what you’re wondering.”</p>

<p>      “No, no,” I said. “That hadn’t even crossed my mind.” I was thinking abusive boyfriend, gambling debt, addiction recovery. I’d seen too many Very Special Episodes.</p>

<p>      “I have a theory that there’s only so much happiness to go around for every square mile,” she said. “I mean it’s just physics, right? Good energy, bad energy.”</p>

<p>      “Huh,” I said. “That certainly would explain some things.”</p>

<p>      “Also,” she said, “I got kicked out of my illegal sublet. Moving to Iowa seemed easier than finding another apartment.” </p>

<p>      Pennsylvania was wider than either of us expected, and Ohio -- fuck! Ohio! -- was like its own country. “Is that map to scale?” I said. The distances seemed impossible.</p>

<p>      “You realize we’ll be treated like refugees,” Chelcie said. “We should try to get a free place to stay. At least a couple meals.”</p>

<p>      We’d been in the car nearly eight hours but had stopped only once, just past Pittsburgh, for gas and burnt coffee and candy bars. “We should have made tee shirts,” I said.</p>

<p>      “We should cover our faces in soot,” she said.</p>

<p>      It was hard to tell sometimes if she was joking.</p>

<p>      “What if they’ve all gone back to hating us?” I said.</p>

<p>      Chelcie shook her head. “There’s a grace period,” she said. “One year, at least. By then we’ll be Midwesterners, and they’ll have no choice but to love us.” </p>

<p>      The landscape reminded me of a Grateful Dead show: repetitive at first, a little boring, until you allowed it to teach you about subtlety.</p>

<p>      “Did you know James Dean was from Indiana?” Chelcie said. “And Red Skelton? Also Van Camp, the bean guy.”</p>

<p>      “Would you give it up with that goddamned guide book?” I said.</p>

<p>      “I like to be informed,” she said. “Did you know, for instance, that Indiana has more highways per square mile than any other state in the country?”</p>

<p>      We’d just crossed the border. It was late afternoon and we were driving straight into the sun.</p>

<p>      “It’s greener here than Ohio,” Chelcie said.</p>

<p>      I thought this was another factoid until I saw that she’d put the book down. And then I realized she was right: it <i>was</i> greener here. The world was full of surprises and incongruities, like how a Yale grad from Connecticut could suddenly be a folksy Texan, or how two steel-reinforced buildings could suddenly be nothing at all.</p>

<p>      “Let’s stop for waffles,” Chelcie said. “Eating breakfast for dinner always makes me feel like I’m getting away with something.”</p>

<p>      So we did. Then a few hours later we stopped again, at a motel just short of Chicago, where I lay in bed for a long time without sleeping. Maybe I was just keyed up from all that driving, or maybe the facts of this trip were finally settling in. Or maybe it was the motel itself, the kind of place my mother had taken pains to warn me against when I was younger, every time we passed one on the interstate. Our room was on the first floor, too, with a door facing the parking lot, which if I remembered correctly made things even more perilous. In the morning I was bleary-eyed and irritable. Chelcie looked like she’d just had a spa treatment.</p>

<p>      “Aren’t you even a little bit nervous?” I said. “I mean, shit. Iowa, you know? Are we really doing this?”</p>

<p>      “Listen,” she said. “I lived for two months in Ecuador, and another two in Belize. Plus a closet in Tribeca, and I mean that literally. A fucking closet. Walk-in, but still. So I think I can handle whatever it is Iowa wants to throw at me.”</p>

<p>      I hadn’t lived anywhere by comparison: Virginia Beach, then college in the mountains, then my tiny efficiency in the outermost reaches of Manhattan. “You know I didn’t tell anyone I was leaving?” I said. “I haven’t even called my parents.”</p>

<p>      “I haven’t talked to my parents in years,” Chelcie said. “They don’t approve of my lifestyle.”</p>

<p>      “You have a lifestyle?” I said.</p>

<p>      She laughed. “I guess it’s the hair? I haven’t corrected them because -- well, shit, what if I was, you know?”</p>

<p>      “I think I might be having a psychotic break,” I said.</p>

<p>      “But if you were having a psychotic break,” she said, “I don’t think you’d realize you were having a psychotic break.”</p>

<p>      “Huh,” I said. “Is that really true?”</p>

<p>      She shrugged. “Sure,” she said. “If you want it to be true. I mean it’s all in your head anyway, right?”</p>

<p>      “I guess so,” I said. “Wait, what?”</p>

<p>      “Let’s just drive,” she said. “You’ll feel better when we get there. I promise.” </p>

<p>      I’ll tell you one strange thing about Iowa, which is that none of the bars stock ginger ale. Say you’ve got a taste for a bourbon and ginger, or a rum and ginger, or an anything and ginger: no dice. Actually, worse than no dice, because instead of just admitting to no ginger ale and asking you to choose again, the bartender will try to pass off this combination of 7-Up and bitters which I guess is meant to approximate the taste of ginger ale but which does so about as well as a sitcom laugh track approximates the joyful noise of real, unadulterated laughter. “It’s the same thing,” the bartender will insist. “Same exact thing.” He’ll look bewildered. Which always makes me angry at first, then sad, because he really doesn’t know the difference.</p>

<p>      There’s other strange stuff, too: like how everyone has accents but refuses to admit to having accents, or how the sky takes up more than its rightful share of the landscape.</p>

<p>      Or how it’s possible to work part time as a handyman for the university and still make rent on the entire upstairs of a house, and not just any house but a house with a yard -- an actual yard! with grass! and two trees! -- plus a wide front porch crammed full of thrift store couches. I spend my mornings hanging paintings in the campus museum or setting up new cubicle dividers in the payroll department or moving A/V equipment from one classroom to another. On sunny afternoons I sip gin and tonics on the porch with the guys who live downstairs, all of whom are part of a band called Jim Dandy! that plays aggressive rap rock, mostly at frat parties. In their songs there’s a lot of yelling. But in real life Jim Dandy! are the nicest people on the face of the planet. They say <i>please</i> and <i>thank you</i>, and for two weeks they insist on calling me “sir,” until I tell them to give it a rest already, that I’m only four or five years older than they are. Six years, tops.</p>

<p>      Also there’s this bar that serves dollar beers every time the Cubs play on TV, and there’s a falafel stand in the middle of the small downtown. A falafel stand! In Iowa! And if you drive or bike or walk just a few miles outside of the city limits, it’s exactly like that postcard: green and infinite and spectacular.</p>

<p>      I don’t watch nearly so much television anymore, though there is this one show I like, where an animated frog is in love with an animated alligator. The alligator loves the frog, too, only he’s always having to overcome his basic alligator nature and resist eating him. It’s a comedy, mostly, but sometimes it’s heartbreaking. Also I watch the local news, which is all about high school football and giant produce and Lutheran pancake suppers. Every now and then the president will come on, or one of his scowly-faced henchmen, and I’ll think “Oh, right, that guy.” Then I’ll go outside for a walk. Iowa is nothing if not a perfectly pleasant amnesia.</p>

<p>      Chelcie only lasted sixteen days. On the seventeenth day, a Tuesday, she sailed back East in a car that looked exactly like the one we drove from New York, maybe was the one we drove from New York. She seemed surprised I wasn’t coming with her, as if a vacation had been the plan all along.</p>

<p>      “You can’t just run away from your problems,” she said.</p>

<p>      “They’re not my problems,” I said. I was aware this might be the wrong kind of attitude, but it was an attitude that worked. The alternative had put me about two days away from a window ledge.</p>

<p>      “What about me?” she said. “What about us?”</p>

<p>      “You could stay,” I said.</p>

<p>      “But you won’t come with me?” she said. “You won’t even consider it?”</p>

<p>      “I can’t,” I said. “I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>      I was sad to watch her drive away, but not as sad as I expected. This is a love story, after all, but it’s not that kind of love story.</p>
