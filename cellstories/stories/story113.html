<h2>A Day By The Lake</h2>
	<h3>Dorianne Emmerton</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>We went out to the woods, the way kids do in a small town: to get away from our parents, from all adults and the restrictions they impose. Eric stole a six pack from his folks who he said were alcoholic enough that they wouldn’t even miss it. We were young enough that the six pack got all four of us pretty drunk.   </p>

<p>  I suppose we were lucky. If the boys had been older than they were, older than us, perhaps they would have taken advantage of us. Eric and Colin were still too young to recognize the advantage of being alone in the woods with girls, much less take it.   </p>

<p>  Betsy and I stripped down to our undies and our bras, which at the time held nothing of any import, and went for a swim. It wasn’t a beach. We had to wade out through cattails and muck. I guess we thought we were daring, brazenly strutting around half undressed in front of boys. The boys giggled – giggling is such a girl-type thing, I’m sure they thought they were chuckling but I remember it as giggling – at our nakedness and our venturing into untested waters but they paid us no more attention than that. I think Betsy and I were disappointed that they didn’t want to swim with us, didn’t want to tease us, didn’t want to do anything at all with us.   </p>

<p>  The boys wandered off. Betsy and I dove underneath and tried to open our eyes but the water was murky and we couldn’t see anything. I struggled to stay underwater, to find Betsy through the wet gloom. I didn’t want to come up for air without her. What if I came up and she didn’t?   </p>

<p>  We thrashed into each other, held on, let ourselves float upward. We broke through the surface and gasped and laughed, still clutching each other. That was a good moment to be alive. I looked at Betsy and her hair was matted with dirt. I laughed and she looked at me and laughed as well. We treaded the water and hugged and laughed louder. I think we wanted the boys to hear us laughing and come to see us. But they didn’t.   </p>

<p>  At the time it felt like pure exhilaration. Looking back I don’t think it was so pure. I could feel Betsy’s budding breasts against mine; I could smell the fresh lake smell, dank and fecund. Later on in life, when I began to find wet trails in the gusset of my underwear, the smell reminded of a freshwater lake.   </p>

<p>  After a couple of swimming strokes we could reach the bottom with our feet. We walked in underwater slow motion through the natural detritus that lines the bottom of a northern forest lake. We reached the land and tumbled down on the grass to dry in the sun. That’s when I noticed a leech on Betsy’s leg. “Bloodsucker!” I screamed and pointed. She screamed as well. Still the boys did not come rushing out of the woods to our aid.   </p>

<p>  She began to cry so I reached over and pinched the wriggly black thing between my fingers and pulled as determinedly as I could. It came off but her leg spouted blood where it had been which made her cry more. I threw the leech away and, without thinking about it, I leaned over and put my mouth on the wound. I sucked her blood.   </p>

<p>  She stopped crying. She looked at me strangely.   </p>

<p>  “Look,” I said, “It’s hardly bleeding now. You’re fine.” I found a piece of Kleenex in the pocket of my jeans, which were lying on the grass near us, and I dabbed her bloodsucker bite with it.</p>

<p>We put our clothes on and went in search of the boys.   </p>

<p>  I saw Colin’s back first. He was far off but I recognized his red and blue striped shirt. I was going to call out to him but Betsy caught my eye and brought her finger to her lips. We were going to sneak up on them. Surprise them, hopefully scare them. It was what they deserved for leaving us alone to fend off leeches by ourselves.   </p>

<p>  We had left our shoes on the grass by the water and being barefoot made stealth possible. We were bush kids: we knew to watch where we were going, to avoid stepping on sticks that would snap and alert others of our movement. I can no longer move that quietly now that I am old.   </p>

<p>  As we drew close we could see Eric as well, lying on the forest floor beside where Colin knelt. When I think back I see it as a very compromising position. If I saw boys in that particular formation, from that particular vantage point, at the age I am now I would suspect something sexual. But that’s not what was going on.   </p>

<p>  Betsy and I exchanged curious glances. We had no context to interpret what we were seeing. They were down low and close and fixated on something we could not yet see.   </p>

<p>  Colin’s back was the most prominent thing in our field of vision and his red and blue stripes were obscuring whatever it was he was looking at. |The only reason he had not yet noticed our presence was that his back was to us. To move to the side would have bettered our sightlines but would also leave us open to detection.   </p>

<p>  Sometimes I wonder why we can’t communicate better without words in our day to day lives. When put to the test, when two people are in agreement to make no sound, so much communication can happen just between the eyes. Betsy and I crept closer, keeping to our original trajectory.</p>

<p>I thought I saw it but I wasn’t sure. And then we were too close. They heard something, a rustle, a breath, they sensed our existence behind them. Colin turned around to look, Eric rolled up on his side to do the same. They left a gap between them, a perfect gap to view the monstrosity they had created.   </p>

<p>  They had crucified a frog.   </p>

<p>  A cross made of twigs stuck out of the ground and two froggy arms were pinned to it, stuck through with thumb tacks. Its feet were crossed and struck through with a third tack. It was still alive and twitching. I heard it gasp. That may just be a trick of memory and not the reality of the time but in my mind I hear the poor frog gasp for air, for freedom, for an existence without pain.   </p>

<p>  Colin and Eric each had twigs in their hands which they had been using to torture the frog. There were ruptures here and there on its body. Frog blood does not look like human blood.   </p>

<p>  “You guys are pigs!” Betsy spit out, then ran away. I knew she must be crying again. I knew she must not want the boys to see her cry. I just stood there.   </p>

<p>  “So?” said Colin. "Do you think we’re pigs too?”   </p>

<p>  “No,” I said. I didn’t. My grandfather raised pigs. I liked pigs.   </p>

<p>  “Do you want to poke it?” He asked and lifted his arm to offer me his twig.   </p>

<p>  “No,” I said. That’s all I said. Just “no.”   </p>

<p>  Later, in high school, Betsy and I were still friends though there were secrets I kept from her. She dated Eric for a while and I stayed away when they were together. Then one evening when we were sitting on the swings smoking illicit cigarettes and Eric and Colin came cutting through the park. She went off to make out with Eric in the bushes. Colin put the moves on me and I let him.   </p>

<p>  It wasn’t that he wasn’t attractive. He was good looking enough in that high school way, where a little bit of acne is ok because everyone else has it too. It wasn’t that I wasn’t into boys, despite what I had begun to understand about my inclinations towards Betsy, inclinations I was never to express. It was that I could never forget that he tortured a frog. And he had asked me if I wanted to torture the frog as well.   </p>

<p>  So I made his dreams come true, I gave him more than he expected. I made out with him madly, as if he was the very object of my burgeoning sexual desire. I knelt down in the sand in front of the swing set and I opened his zipper. I took his dick in my mouth. I’m sure it was the first time a girl did that for him. It would be the last time he’d let any girl do that to him for a while. I bit down as hard as I could.   </p>

<p>  In my memory his scream is exactly the same volume and timbre as Betsy’s when she saw the leech on her leg.   </p>

<p>  I was known around the school as Cocktooth for a while after that but I wasn’t really teased – I was treated, to my face, with a certain distanced respect. Betsy stuck by me. She assumed that Colin had tried to force himself on me and that’s why I did what I did. A lot of people assumed that. It was the most reasonable thing to think, I suppose. It probably hurt Colin’s reputation more than mine, but that’s what he got for telling people about it. Why would a nice girl like me offer to suck a cock then bite it? He had been taking advantage of me, surely. I like to think it made more guys wary of taking advantage of girls in my high school. But maybe it didn’t. Maybe it wasn’t a lesson for anyone. Maybe nothing we do makes a lick of difference. But to be at peace with my own history I like to think I made a bite of difference and that poor frog’s soul now rests in peace.</p>
