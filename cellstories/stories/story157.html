	<p>
		</p><p><h4>You know Where I'm Going</h4></p><p>I picked him up at the Gas For Less station on Lincoln. He was overweight and a little disheveled, but otherwise didn't seem unusual. 
<br> 
<br>He got in and said, "You know where I'm going." I didn't and told him so. What followed was a back and forth lasting a good five minutes--he couldn't believe it, he was convinced I knew; meanwhile the meter was running, we drove west on Irving Park for want of a more precise destination. Finally, he made peace with my ignorance and launched into a rambling telling of his life story, our friendship sealed by the $20 he gave me. He told me about how his family's been in Chicago a long time, pointed out buildings they owned along the way. 
<br> 
<br>We were heading south on Pulaski now. He said that he'd had some problems, been living in Indianapolis but was back in town to perform his one-man show impersonating Chris Farley at Second City. Periodically through this saga, he would ask how much money he'd given me, growing more satisfied each time I repeated the same answer. We were now best buddies. Eventually, he broke down and told me where he wanted to go. 
<br> 
<br> We pulled up in front of the Lathrop Homes projects. It was after 5pm, rush hour, and the guys hanging out out front were doing a brisk business. My friend handed me another $20 and told me to wait and ran out to the young entrepreneurs. After a little discussion, he was pointed toward a window at which he proceeded to scream at the top of his lungs, "GIVE ME DRUGS!!!!!"</p>

<p>The two guys looked over at me with a look that said, "What have you unleashed on us??" It was about then that I decided that there'd been enough entertainment for the evening and tore out of there without looking back. 
<br> 
<br><h4>Tony DiCarlo's a Dead Man</h4></p><p><i>That's a bunch of bullshit</i>, he said. It was a clip of John McCain's speech about continuing the Iraq Debacle. My passenger's astute political analysis continued with a brief psychological profile of our current leader and the true reasons for our military involvement in that part of the globe. Apparently it was all due to the personal dislikes of Bush Senior's towards certain Middle Eastern bigwigs. 
<br> 
<br><i>Wadda ya think about that?</i> was how the current events lesson ended. I responded the best I could: in awe, of course, of such a brilliant intellect. Satisfied, he went on to tell me about how he'd just sold a condo and was heading to the Stone Lotus to celebrate. His trip there would not be all pleasure however. 
<br> 
<br>Apparently, the bouncer there owed him $800 and he was gonna collect. <i>If he doesn't cough it up, Tony DiCarlo's a dead man!!! It's been a year and with the juice it comes to about $14,000.</i> At this last detail, I inquired whether he was a loan shark. Though meant as a joke, it wasn't received that way. <i>Why's that funny?</i> He wanted to know. 
<br> 
<br><i>Take a look at my face so you can identify it for the cops, when you hear about him beaten with a tire iron.</i> To the question about whether such violence was warranted over such a small sum, he answered that he didn't consider what he aimed to do as violent. If it causes internal injury, that's violent. Rearranging a guy's skull with a blunt object's no big deal.
<br> 
<br>He offered to cut me in, to reassure me of the purity of his intentions. I declined and wished him continuing success in all his future endeavors, which sadly did not involve much of a gratuity for his wheel-man.
<br> 
<br><h4>Burnout</h4></p><p>Saw him in the left turn lane on LaSalle the other day, waiting to go west on Chicago; he rolled down the window and yelled a question out to a couple walking past. Obviously dumbfounded, they kept walking as if the cabbie'd never engaged them in any way, while he smiled to himself, continuing the conversation on his own. 
<br> 
<br>Used to see him at the Checker garage before they went out of business. A worn puffy winter coat with a hood, thick black glasses, a black shirt with the top button buttoned and dandruff dotting the chest like a light dusting on a winter eve, white hair combed in a '50s sort of way, buzzed short round the ears and the neck. His skin reddened to an unhealthy hue, though probably not from boozing, he doesn't seem like the type; though what do we ever really know about people when they're out of our sight? He'd be in line to pay the lease on his cab, trying to shoot the shit with the others, coming off like some sort of space alien, causing them to take a step or two back, as if two or three feet would keep his insanity from spreading and crawling up their legs. 
<br> 
<br> His name's Mike, his last name escapes me, he's been a taxi driver a long long time. He's got a collection of plastic garbage bags that he hauls around like luggage; the big black one has a note, written in thick marker, taped to it. Never been able to make out what it says, though it starts with his name and goes on to cover most of the side of the bag. When he's waiting at the long table in the driver's room, it's used as a pillow for when he's passed out. 
<br> 
<br> He'll only drive a Checker when most of the fleet are Yellow cabs; this means that he'll wait many hours longer more often than not. No incoming driver escapes his interrogations--"You dropping? Is it a Checker? No... Oh, alright"--more backing up or taking the long way in an attempt to evade his attentions. Save for once telling him to get the hell away from me, when he stood too close in line, I'd successfully avoided any substantive interaction with him, except for once. We'd both been at the garage for hours and on one of the strolls outside he cornered me. He told of his loneliness, of his landlady raising his rent, he asked if I had family, saying he had none. There was no graceful way to disengage, short of just walking away, so that's what I did. 
<br> 
<br>He's the walking embodiment of the worst fears. A solitary, forgotten man twisted and broken by a job that tests the endurance of those much better equipped than he ever could've been. He's what we end up as in our nightmares; taking up space and being tolerated in this world, but just barely enough to be able to draw breath. 
<br> 
<br><h4>Voice of America</h4></p><p>What's the dollar extra for? he asked after lumbering into the backseat. Gas Surcharge, the answer, brought a look of disbelief and a response to the effect of <i>$3.25 just to sit your ass down!?</i> 
<br> 
<br><i>There ain't no gas shortage, just a lot of greed and these politicians are in on it. If McCain wins nothing will change and the other one's a monkey, in more ways than one. It's not the same America anymore, more like the United States of Zimbabwe. I used to drive in New York and I'd get into fights with'em just for fun, the Africans and the Arabians.</i> At this point we stopped briefly at a service station where he got out and peeled off some bills for a mechanic in the garage. 
<br> 
<br><i>Know any good Indian restaurants near Union Station?</i> He then consulted the White Pages he had with him, settled on an address, and directed me onwards. <i>Most places by me are all grease, if it was up to me they'd blow up all the McDonalds, so when I'm downtown I figure I'll try something different. I own a coupla towtrucks, let others do the driving, but maybe I'll get my license back one of these days. Trying to start up an internet thing too, drop-shipping, electronics and baby supplies, they're pretty hot these days.</i>
<br> 
<br>We pulled up to his Indian restaurant, which turned out to be a Jewish Deli. Doing his best Paki accent, he conveyed his appreciation for having an American cab driver for a change. 
<br> 
<br><h4>Goodbye Nerd</h4></p><p>A Thursday night outside Buddy Guy's Blues Legends. He crouches slightly with his left hand extended uncertainly, possibly desiring transport. He pushes past the couple at the curb and into the back seat and barks, "Get on the Eisenhower, going to Oak Park..." 
<br> 
<br>His eyes wander away from each other toward opposite ends of his face, spittle glistens from his patchy beard, his hair greased back, teeth crooked and gapped, "They oughta know how to fight, wasn't doin' nothin' fuckn' nerds. What a joke, hahahaha. Knew a guy once who married a nerd, never amounted to nothing." </p>

<p>What followed this information was a series of alternately guttural and whining animal noises apparently continuing a conversation this driver isn't privy to. 
<br> 
<br> Off the Austin exit his last-second instruction was to turn left, he barely bothers because staring out the window and intoning, "goodbye nerd goodbye nerd goodbye nerd," at every passersby is of utmost priority. Locking eyes briefly in the rearview, he suddenly asks matter-of-factly about how the night's going; more unnerving in its way than the incoherent babble that came before. 
<br> 
<br> We roll westbound on Roosevelt through Berwyn, then left on Harlem passing the town welcome sign for Riverside. Two municipalities past his stated destination, asked whether we were close, he says, "I'll show you" 
<br> 
<br> Approaching the train tracks he wants me to pull over, which is accomplished by rudely cutting off an 18-Wheeler. Fully ready to be stiffed or worse, the long minutes of fumbling through pockets yields a crumpled $20 along with six $1s. "It's all I got," he says, to which no argument is offered, more than glad not to end up a severed head in his icebox. He crosses through traffic toward the light of another tavern.</p>
