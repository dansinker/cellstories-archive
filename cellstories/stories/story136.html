<h2>Evalutation</h2>
	<h3>John H. Matthews</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p><b>Job Knowledge</b> 
<br>Dennis, in the first six months in your new position on Level D, you have demonstrated you are a quick learner. After mastering the basics of your job, you took it upon yourself to observe the intricate details of your coworkers lives, assessing strengths and weaknesses and making sound conclusions regarding the pecking order of your work environment. </p>

<p>You have correctly concluded that you have advanced as far as you can go with this company and are fairly certain you will spend the rest of your life in this low-paying, meaningless shit job. </p>

<p>Computer records provided by our Systems Department show you have interests outside of your job, including but not limited to Dwarf Porn, Ecoterrorism and Self Mutilation. </p>

<p>Having a vast knowledge of odd facts enables you to startle and confuse your coworkers with non sequiturs such as ‘Do you know where the world’s smallest baseball is kept?’ </p>

<p>Answer: ‘The Vatican’. </p>

<p>Your ability to compile and interpret incredible amounts of data from history and render them into bizarre and wholly unique conspiracy theories indicates you are either extremely gifted or clinically insane. </p>

<p><b>Judgment</b> 
<br>Dennis, during the course of your work you are usually able to make sound judgments based on your understanding of the problem at hand, however there have been times when your judgment has not always been appropriate. </p>

<p>Instances of this include unwise decisions regarding personal hygiene. In particular, your reluctance to bathe, your increasingly wild “bushman” hair style, your decision to file your cuspids into fangs and your untamed facial hair. The image you present Dennis, was summed up concisely by Margie in Accounting. “He looks like a werewolf.” </p>

<p>Frankly Dennis, you scare people. </p>

<p><b>Quantity / Quality of Work</b> 
<br>Dennis, since you rarely venture outside of your basement office with any quantifiable work under your arm, your output is mysterious. You could be productive (and we hope you are) but honestly, we have no idea. </p>

<p>A recent visit to your office where it was observed that you had started a hydroponic marijuana farm would seem to indicate that you are very productive but not in a way that best fits our company outlook and needs. </p>

<p>Still, the elaborate set up of lights and other equipment was very impressive and we hope that once this operation is flowing smoothly for you, you will return to doing whatever it is we hired you to do. 
<br> 
<br><b>Reliability</b> 
<br>Dennis, one thing you never fail to be is late. Time records indicate that you are late almost exactly one hour each day. This level of consistency shows a firm dedication to your job and is to be commended. Your sick days, though excessive, indicate an  unwavering concern for the welfare of your office mates whom you wish to protect from infection by staying at home on those days. </p>

<p>The last record anyone could find of your attending a meeting was in the minutes to a task force you were on in 1991 that called itself ‘The Ankle Breakers’. From reading the yellowed, crumbling minutes to the meeting, about all I could make of it was that you were dealing with some sort of customer service problem at the time. Sounds like a pretty wild group. I note there was a member named ‘Gregory Retail’. Was that his real name? Also, didn’t he supposedly kill his family a year or two after moving to New Mexico? I don’t know... you hear stories. </p>

<p><b>Teamwork / Cooperation</b> 
<br>Dennis, you are always willing to assist others except at those times when you are not. Most of the time yes, sometimes no. It really depends on your mood. By staunchly refusing simple requests (for no apparent reason) and gladly accepting others (but then reversing that pattern later), you keep management on its toes and create in one the feeling of approaching a cryptozoological animal that may or may not be rabid. 
<br> 
<br><b>Communication</b> 
<br>Dennis, you communicate with an almost torrential stream of needless detail. A simple question like ‘What’s the weather like outside?’ sends you off on a 20 minute explanation of high pressure systems and wind currents. </p>

<p>A simple request to observe a policy will lead you to quote an issue of Omni Magazine about the emerging use of hybrid vehicles. </p>

<p>Please keep your defense mechanisms at home as they impede proper communication and generally make you insufferable. </p>

<p><b>Optional-Specific / Initiative</b>
<br> 
<br>Dennis, it takes more than a reckless disregard for company policy and U.S. Drug law to start up an illicit drug farm in the basement of your company headquarters... it takes initiative. From all appearances, you have scads of it. </p>

<p>We would also like to commend you on averting the liquor shortage at last year’s company picnic. Thanks to you, we all got rocked. </p>

<p>Anyway, Dennis, keep it up. Do what’s right when you think it’s necessary and how you see fit. </p>

<p>One thing: just don’t ask for a raise because the company budget is in the dumper.</p>
