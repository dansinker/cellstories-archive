<h2>Foreigner in a Straight Land</h2>
	<h3>J. Adams Oaks</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>Men.</p>

<p>Men were terrible, awful, scary, sweaty, cocky, dangerous creatures.</p>

<p>I mean, I know I’m one of them. I get that finally. But before I came out of the closet, I felt like there were two types of people: human beings and Men with a capital M. And me, I was just a human being--all lower case letters. They were so alien to me--throwing footballs and slapping each other on the back, skateboarding and not talking much, and when they did say something, they spoke in a code I had no translation for. It was like I was a foreigner in a straight land. So for a long time I hid as best I could. Don’t get me wrong: I still moved amongst the natives. I learned their ceremonies and ate the local food. I even imitated their language and dated their women when necessary. So it’s ironic that it took moving to a foreign country for me to find my native land and really start living life, instead of watching it all go by.</p>

<p>See, I came out in Spain. It wasn’t until a year later when I got back to the States that I found out that coming out was all the rage and there was even somebody named Rue Paul was singing about it. Everybody was bi-curious and gay-friendly and trying real real hard to find something gay inside of them. And I remember spending many late nights reassuring straight friends that they didn’t have a closet to come out of. Like my friend Beth who told me she thought she’d fallen in love with her female Spanish professor.</p>

<p>“Like, I mean, how do I know?” she asked me. “I can’t stop thinking about her and I can’t wait to get to her class and sometimes I think about kissing her, maybe.”</p>

<p>“Well, you could be gay,” I told her, “but, Beth, you know what lesbians do, right?”</p>

<p>“Not really,” she said. And when I told her the down-and-dirty--I mean, the Down-And-Dirty--her face wrinkled up and she said “Eeeew.”</p>

<p>“Then you are NOT gay, Beth, ‘cause that’s what lesbians to do. They actually LOVE it, gross as it may sound.”</p>

<p>Anyway, for me--before that fashion hit the streets--I’d spent most of my twenty years trying damned hard to stay in the closet. I had never met one openly gay person. I’d only heard of “The Gays” or “Homosexuals” before, but all those men were lurking in bathrooms or dressing as women for some reason or were priests and gym teachers touching little boys. I wasn’t any of that. I was just a guy who happened to really like other guys. I mean REALLY like guys. Those poor girls I’d had to date, well... Let’s just say I was good at pretending I’d passed out... And as a virgin, I spent every single day pretending I wasn’t looking at every single man that passed by.</p>

<p>So... When I finally got to Spain, I was pretty much screwed. Here were these olive-skinned, dark-wavy-haired passionate Marlboro Men--capital M--strutting around making my head get woozy. But there still was a wall up between me and other guys; I had no flirting skills, certainly no dating skills, and no idea how other guys met each other. It made me feel even more foreign and it made Spain feel even more surreal. It wasn’t home, you know? My folks weren’t there. My best friends were far away. Everyone was a stranger. For god’s sake, I was speaking a different language so much my brain hurt.</p>

<p>I gotta tell you I did fall in love there--with Madrid.  The city is more Chicago than New York or Paris--a lot working class and a little too serious. But it’s not all gypsies and bullfights and flamenco and sangria (though there’s a lot of that). It’s also all-night bars and lazy afternoons at a café in El Parque Retiro with friends and moped rides through honking traffic jams surrounded by romantic old architecture. I’d almost say Madrid was my first true love, but that wouldn’t be fair to Joe. See, Joe was this guy I met on my abroad program. It’s February 13th, 1991. </p>

<p>There is no such thing as the internet or cellphones or laptop computers. And the song I rewind on my Walkman again and again is “Freedom ‘90” by George Michael.</p>

<p>Okay, So I’m at a Joe’s surprise party, and he gets a birthday card with a shirtless guy on it. Hmm... I think. Interesting. The girls giggle, assuming everybody knows Joe’s out of the closet and my heart races. I try not to stare, but study him in detail: He’s cute, quiet, kind of sulky, and pretty much a regular everyday guy. Is that possible?</p>

<p>Anyway, I wish him a happy birthday, shake his hand and leave, because at this point I can’t really deal with him since I’m living in a really deep, dark, melodramatic hole of loneliness where nobody else could actually understand what I was going through. No, actually, I was living in a neighborhood called Alfonso XIII with two guys just behind a highway billboard in a little brick house that we called “The Shit Shack.” It had no phone and a wood-burning stove we fed with old telephone poles. It had a refrigerator in the living room and a gas tank for cooking and hot water. Those tanks were called “bonbones” because of their shape, like orange-wrapped chocolates. Almost a week after Joe’s birthday party, I used that tank in the bathroom to try to kill myself. It finally all made complete sense: The best option really was death. It’d make things easier on my family, on my friends. There’d be no shame. No having to wait for me to die of the AIDS I’d surely get. I stuffed newspaper in the cracks around the door and window, then separated the line from the tank, sat in the bathtub, and cried. And cried. </p>

<p>But that shitty fucking house just had too many holes in it, and wind whipped through cracks around the window. Man, that pissed me off. But it got my sobbing to slow down. I reattached the gas-line, removed the newspaper and thought, “I guess I can try talking to that Joe guy. He seems pretty normal. For a Man...”</p>

<p>So that night, I walked four blocks to the closest payphone and called Joe. I practiced a casual tone before I dialed, “Hey, uh, man, you around tomorrow? Can I stop by? It’s no big deal. I just wanted to hang out.” I’d never spent time with him before one-on-one, but he didn’t seem to mind, said to stop by the next day.</p>

<p>God, I remember February 21, 1991 so well--the colors, the sounds, the crisp sunny day as I chain-smoked Fortuna cigarettes all the way to Joe’s place. He met me at the door to his apartment building just south of Atocha--that’s the train station that would be bombed ten years later, that boom so close to where we stood we would have felt it. Joe wore his red Gortex jacket with the hood, because there was still a nip in the air and brought his camera, because he’s a fantastic photographer.</p>

<p>“Hi,” he said.</p>

<p>“Hi,” I said.</p>

<p>“Thought I’d take some pictures. Wanna walk around the neighborhood for a little while?”</p>

<p>I could only nod, because I thought I was going to die. What was I thinking? I couldn’t do this.</p>

<p>Jesus, shame is such a heavy coat to wear, isn’t it?</p>

<p>The short walk down Paseo de Las Delicias felt like miles. Small talk had never been so painful and words had never been a struggle for me, but the three I wanted to say made me feel like I was going to puke. I needed to sit down and rest my brain, so we found a little park tucked between some high-rise apartments. Joe and I sat on either ends of the same bench. It was hot in the sun. Kids played and mothers watched, waving fans to cool their faces. “Um...,” I said and looked down. “I gotta tell you something...” Between my feet, in the red dirt, cockroaches ate bread left for pigeons. Joe snapped photos. “Don’t puke,” I told myself. “Don’t puke.” He took a couple shots of me. I didn’t even know this guy, but he was about to become the most important person in my life whether he wanted to or not. Just by listening. Just by smiling. Just by understanding. “Joe, I gotta tell you...” and I said it.</p>

<p>And nothing changed.</p>

<p>God, it sounds so melodramatic, but the only surprising thing was how normal the world still felt. Kids still played. Cockroaches still skittered. Joe still smiled. I took the deepest breath I’d ever taken and then we talked. Or rather I asked questions and he answered them as best he could. The poor guy was hardly out himself, but he still did have “experience.” I remember asking things like: So how do gay people know each other are gay? And, in a couple, is one of the guys the man and one of the guys the woman? Have you ever been to the gay neighborhood? And what’s that rainbow flag for? On and on for, well, not just for that night, but days and days. Hey, I don’t have to like leather, do I?</p>

<p>See, the trick with “coming out” is that it’s not just that one step: “I’m gay!” and everything is hunky-dory. I’d only just started a process that happens for the rest of my life, a process of learning to tell the truth and getting rid of that damned shame. So there I was in Madrid, practicing being honest, the knots in my stomach loosening a bit each time I said, “I need to tell you something: I’m gay...” And waited for a response. These are some of the reactions I got, in no particular order:</p>

<p>“I’m so happy you finally figured it out! Congratulations!” </p>

<p>“Vale, vale. Coño. ¿Y que mas da?”</p>

<p> “Boy, that explains a lot. You’ve been acting so weird lately.” </p>

<p>And then there was Chris, my roommate at “The Shit Shack.” I was so afraid he was going to punch me in the face that I took him all the way to the fancy MacDonald’s on La Gran Vía, because I figured he wouldn’t make a scene in public. Instead, he said, “So? What do you want? A cookie? A trophy?” I got to thinking--you know, Chris was right. What did I want? It wasn’t like a badge of courage. I didn’t do anything special. Being gay was just one little tiny piece of me, right? Like my hair or my shoe size, really. Why was I making such a big deal out of it?</p>

<p>But that’s not what you want to hear about, do you? You want to hear about the sex. Well, yes, Joe and I would eventually start dating. We’d take a walk down El Paseo del Prado and into the Botanical Gardens and decide to be boyfriends, and YES finally I would get rid of that damned of virginity. I would tell him, “It’s time to get rid of it. And you’re going to help me out.” So during Spring Break on the southern coast of Spain, in a room with a bunk bed, while our unsuspecting friends snored in rooms around us, the night before we took a ferryboat to Africa, escorted by flying fish and dolphins, we did “it.” And it was good. More importantly, after twenty-one LONG years, I did “it.” And then it was gone. </p>

<p>But that’s not the story I like to tell. Usually, I like to remember the moment I knew things would get better. A week or two after that day in the park, before I’d come out to anyone else and before we’d started dating, Joe and I went on a trip with our study-abroad group to Córdoba, an ancient Roman town in Andalusia. And after a full day of sightseeing, a late night of drinking, Joe and I snuck off to take a walk. We wondered outside the city wall, across a bridge, under a streetlight, along the river into a playground to sit on the swings. I started in on my usual grilling: Have you told your parents yet? Do you know any Spanish gay guys? Do you think LOOK gay? On and on, Joe patiently answering, gently teasing me while this little bit of tension began to form between us. The city had quieted down and it was getting chilly, so we headed back to the hotel. Our shoulders bumped occasionally, and I felt okay. I mean, I didn’t feel so bad all the time anymore. I was feeling normal, and I hoped his shoulder would bump me again. We had separate rooms, so Joe walked me to mine to say goodnight.</p>

<p>Before he left, he leaned up and kissed me on the lips. Not hard or long, but enough. Then he looked me in the eyes and mumbled, “That’s just how gay people say goodbye. They kiss on the lips. Um. Even just friends.” And off he went. I just stood there, leaning against the wall. My first kiss. No, I mean, I’d smooched girls before: Like the rebel girl in black behind my high school, and popular girls, sexy girls, smart girls, foreign girls, all with my eyes open, bored, and trying hard to like it.</p>

<p>So this was different. This was the real thing. This was the feeling everybody else was talking about. Now I knew. Now I understood nectar and skin and electricity and blossoms and winks and nudges. That kiss explained romance novels and cliché lines, mood-lighting and rose-colored lenses. All that in an instant, from just one kiss. Like a bee sting or a splinter or a sneeze, that kiss– THAT KISS made me start to get life, made me want to really live it, and not be such a foreigner anymore.</p>
