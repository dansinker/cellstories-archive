<h2>Through the Glass</h2>

		</p><p>An impossibly long streamer of clear fluid stretched slowly from Brother Dan's nose.</p>

<p>"It's strange," I thought to myself, "that I'm sitting here watching this angry old man preach in this little room." </p>

<p>Spittle flew from Brother Dan's mouth, and I worried for the carpeted floor, the microphone in front of him. He was a wiry old Pentecostal with a flat-top. He wore a short-sleeved button-down and faded Dickies. His voice cracked as he pronounced homosexuality an abomination. "God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve, and in the Book of Leviticus..."  </p>

<p>I winced, and not just from the speakers in my headphones rattling and squeaking. I adjusted the studio mic's levels as Brother Dan thundered on, oblivious to the river flowing from his nose.  </p>

<p>"Will I have to clean that up?" I thought. "And how the hell did I get here, wondering whether I'll have to clean up this angry old man's mucus?"  </p>

<p>The answers to those questions were as follows: </p>

<p>Yes, I would have to clean up Brother Dan's snot. It was not the only time I'd have to do this.</p>

<p>And the way I got there, watching Brother Dan spew phlegm and righteousness, was that a few months earlier, I had decided I was done with religion.  </p>

<p>It was spring 1997, and I was 18. For my entire life before, I had been very Catholic. But the hierarchy, the thought that enough authority could answer any question, these things bothered me.  </p>

<p>I was 18 and indulging a growing sense of intellectual rebellion. Then, one Sunday in spring, a priest at my church decided to clarify who was in charge. "The Church isn't a democracy," Father John said, jabbing the air with his index finger, "...if you have a question, the answer comes from one of three sources: Sacred Scripture, Sacred Tradition, or the Sacred Authority of the Pope."  </p>

<p>That was the moment I realized I could decide to stop attending Mass.  </p>

<p>The next week, my mom came in to wake me for church, as she had done on every previous Sunday morning. "Church in an hour," she said. </p>

<p>"I'm not going," I said, sitting up in my bed. </p>

<p>"What? Are you sick?" </p>

<p>"No, I'm just not going." </p>

<p>I should've paid attention to my mom's face tightening, her hands clenching and unclenching in her lap. My mom should've said "I think a lot of it is bullshit, too, but we go together, and that's what matters."   </p>

<p>I think that would have been true. But love and religion and guilt and devotion are easily blurred, so, instead, my mom said "But...but it's almost Easter." </p>

<p>And because I didn't really understand what we were talking about, and because I thought (and still sort of believe) that if something's funny enough, it's OK to say out loud, I said "Yeah, I know. I've thought a lot about it, and I'm giving up Catholicism for Lent."  </p>

<p>We were quiet for a while. My mom stood up and left my room, pulling the door quietly shut behind her.  </p>

<p>So I was available later that spring when a teacher recommended me to some friends of his. They were looking for someone to cover nights and weekends for the summer at their AM radio station, WGFS AM 1340, in Covington, Georgia. Covington was 30 minutes from the Atlanta suburb where I lived. It wasn’t exactly rural, but it wasn’t far off. WGFS was one of those stations whose signal was so weak, you could barely hear the crazy preacher through the static. It was one of those stations you tune into for a moment, out of morbid curiosity, before you turn off the radio, grateful to live somewhere and not nowhere.  </p>

<p>But I was 18. I was harboring unreasonable fantasies about a life as a writer-slash-director-slash-public-intellectual. WGFS, a dead-end in the odd world of Southern AM radio, seemed like a GREAT idea.  </p>

<p>A tall, round kid, barely older than me, met me at the door when I showed up for my interview. His name was Brian, and it turned out he had graduated from my high school a few years ahead of me. </p>

<p>Brian gave me the tour, which didn't take long. There was a small, dirty office and two booths. "So this is where it ALL happens," Brian said. "We mainly do rebroadcasts. During the baseball season, we air Braves games. I have a call-in sports show on Fridays." </p>

<p>"How many people listen?" I asked. </p>

<p>Brian paused. "Well, right now, there's you and me. So that's AT LEAST two...so the main part of your job..." </p>

<p>"So I got the job?" I asked. </p>

<p>"Well, prolly. We need somebody real bad," he said. </p>

<p>Brian pointed out the small studio adjacent to the booth we occupied, separated by a large sheet of soundproof glass. It had a standing microphone and a few folding chairs. "In there is where we broadcast 'Sunday Morning on WGFS.' That's the main part of your job."  </p>

<p>Every Sunday morning from 7 AM to noon, WGFS sold air time to church groups. Half hour slots, live, back to back. For FIVE HOURS. "You'll make sure that whoever IS listening hears them," Brian said. </p>

<p>And so every Sunday morning between my high school graduation and the start of college, instead of sitting in Church with my family, I would be watching Brother Dan work himself into a frothing, snotting fury. I'd traded an hour of doubt each week for five hours of non-stop Jesus. </p>

<p>It never occurred to me that I could just not take the job. I felt guilty about not going to Church. So I think Sunday Morning on WGFS was a sort of penance. I gave up Catholicism in a very Catholic way. I didn't realize this at the time. I just knew that sitting in Mass and sitting through Sunday Morning on WGFS felt similar. Both made me feel distant from people capable of belief.  </p>

<p>As I watched Brother Dan and the other broadcasters, the glass separating us felt miles thick. </p>

<p>Before Brother Dan was a large, warm singer named Shavonda. Like the rest of the broadcasters, she was always prompt, and genuinely courteous. "Mornin', young man," Shavonda would say. "Doin' well?" </p>

<p>"Yes, Ma'am," I'd say. "Everything's fine."  </p>

<p>"Well Praise God for that." As we spoke, Shavonda would reach into her enormous purse. Thirty minutes of air-time cost fifty dollars. Shavonda pulled the crumpled bills out of her bag. She would sigh as she presented them to me.  </p>

<p>I always felt a bit awkward taking the cash. These churches and families gave their hard-earned money to transmit religion to the tiny listening area of WGFS. Somehow, it made me sad.  </p>

<p>Once in the booth, Shavonda would close her eyes and belt out a capella hymns. I don't know anything about music, but, to this day, I remember her as one of the finest singers I've ever heard. Something haunted me, though, about Shavonda and her heart-achingly gorgeous songs in that small, empty room. I couldn't shake my suspicion that Shavonda was pouring her heart out and that nobody was listening. Anywhere.  </p>

<p>If Shavonda worried about it, it never showed. She was as happy and warm after her show as before. She’d wrap up, wish me well, and leave the studio. Most of the time, Brother Dan—who was next—would be waiting in the hallway. </p>

<p>“Good mornin’, Ms. Shavonda,”  </p>

<p>“Mornin’, Brother Dan.” </p>

<p>I was fascinated by this place where people that don’t normally talk to each other greeted one another by name. In side-by-side time-slots, you could hear all manner of Southern religion. They all paid their fifty dollars, they all took their turn in the little studio, reaching out to whoever was listening.</p>

<p>Brother Dan was thundering away. "The Catholic church is the whore of Babylon!" he shouted as the next presenters showed up.  </p>

<p>The Gospel Starlighters. The four elderly African American men in phenomenal suits with matching metallic blue ties presented me with a check from their church. The Gospel Starlighters advertised themselves as the oldest practicing gospel quartet in the state of Georgia. As in, nobody else their age was doing anything like this. To a man, they all topped 70.  </p>

<p>They brought a snare, an electric guitar, and an electric base. The Starlighters couldn't hear the instruments, so they turned the amps up all the way. Then they couldn't hear their voices, so they just shouted. Audience or no audience, I had no trouble believing that there was something plainly true and good about four men on the precipice of their own mortality rattling the walls with songs like "Will the Circle be Unbroken."  </p>

<p>"Fornicators!" Brother Dan squawked from next door.  </p>

<p>Courtesy prevented the Starlighters and I from commenting on what we heard, but I saw the looks they gave each other.  </p>

<p>Brother Dan wrapped up, right on time, as usual. I killed his mic and played my fill music, some bland choral hymn. "One minute, gentlemen," I said to the Starlighters, heading into the studio with some towels. </p>

<p>Brother Dan stood in the middle of the room, blinking and out of breath. "How'd I sound?" </p>

<p>"Loud, Brother Dan, good and loud," I said, rubbing down the mic and the carpet as best I could. </p>

<p>Brother Dan nodded and watched me. "So you like working all these machines in there?" </p>

<p>I thought about it. "Yeah. I do."</p>

<p>Brother Dan nodded some more. "Good. A young man ought have a skill. And you say you're starting college in the fall?" </p>

<p>"Yes, sir, that's right." </p>

<p>"Good," Brother Dan said. "That's good." </p>

<p>He fished in his pants pocket. "Here," he held out a shaking hand, "you're a good boy, and it's a big world. I hope God blesses you." </p>

<p>I opened my hand. Brother Dan dropped a single quarter onto my palm. I wanted to find it ridiculous, Brother Dan and his blessing and his quarter. But I also knew that Brother Dan was utterly sincere, and that that sincerity was all he had. “Thanks, Brother Dan, See you next week.” </p>

<p>Brother Dan blinked at me for a moment longer, once again a bewildered old man in an empty room. He slowly exited the booth, wishing the Starlighters well on his way out.  </p>

<p>One of the Starlighters stuck his head in the room. "All clear?" he asked. </p>

<p>"Good to go," I said, "Have a good show."  </p>

<p>It’s been almost a decade since I left Georgia, but part of me remains at WGFS. I still sit in that run-down radio station, working the switches of equipment that's rapidly becoming obsolete. To my right is a wall of sound-proof glass through which I can see into an adjacent room. In the center of that small room, there is a microphone. Through the glass, I watch Brother Dan and Shavonda and the Gospel Starlighters giving themselves entirely to the unknowable space beyond the walls of the empty room. Through the glass, I watch them all, and I wonder if there is anyone listening.</p>
