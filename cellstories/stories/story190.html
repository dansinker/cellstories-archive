<h2>The Slop, The Walk, and The Bop</h2>

	<p>
		</p><p>&#8211;Bourgeois incompetence, the white coat wearing director of the Soviet Bureau of Iconography hissed at me.   </p>

<p>I wanted to slink instantly back to my desk job denying travel visas to crying widows in Krakow. Anything was preferable to being trained by anymore fucking Russians.  </p>

<p>&#8211;Like this. Like this, the director said, dipping a wide brush into the can of paint and flicking it onto the canvas lying on the studio ground. Think American! He screamed. Think about crushing freedom with self-destructing capital.  He slapped my chest, leaving red marks. Pretend you are alienated from labor products! Put your working class derangement into it! You have been driven to abstract confusion by profit. Put your heart into its creation. </p>

<p>He slapped my chest again before upending the paint can onto the floor and smothering the simple rendering of my boyhood home on Lake Lubusz. </p>

<p>I hated Moscow. It was cold, smoke choked, and my Russian was terrible. The only phrase I could say with assurance was one I could never say to anyone or, given that my room was probably bugged, to myself. It was the adage: Russian men are so drunk their wives prefer to screw capitalists as of late. 
<br>This was my second time being sent to Moscow. </p>

<p>I had been put onto the desk assignment in the visa approvals office —where no visas were ever assigned and widows wept— because I had bungled my first assignment, so much so I nearly faced a firing squad.   A son of a party official, I was just out of the academy when I was selected for special travel intelligence training. I was taught to spy, mostly because of those family connections, but also because my French was mysteriously impeccable for a Pole.  </p>

<p>The Soviet instructors augmented this with accent lessons. I was tailored in city and country outfits. They taught me to have French opinions on everything, like the right way to prepare duck confit. They told me I might have to defend, perhaps with my fists, the correct way to make potato Lyonnaise.  Imprisoned sommeliers poured wine into me until I was gouty.  </p>

<p>I was sent to Paris on a dry run as a French businessman dealing with the export of vinegars. All I had to do was stay at a hotel, dine in restaurants, shop, speak, and think in French.   My first day went well and I spent the evening at the Folies Bergère, where I hired a woman and took her back to my hotel.  Drunk, I began to sing in Polish to the elevator operator.  He looked at me. </p>

<p>The next day I went down to the lobby, copy of Paris Match under my arm, Gitane in my mouth, and the stink of a trollop’s perfume still on my skin: a perfectly fake Frenchman. I saw several police at the front desk. I darted into the restaurant and out the patio door. I hopped the ornate wrought iron fence and ran. At a phone booth I dialed a panic number, blew an ultra sonic whistle into the receiver and waited for a small black BMW to escort me over the border.  The driver did not say one word. </p>

<p>While my superiors in Poland were never sure if I was compromised or not the fact remained that I abandoned precious false papers and a passport. A complete identity that took a year to create a paper trail for had to be retired and burned. Anyone not a son of a high-ranking party member would have been shot.  </p>

<p>This is what I heard whispered behind my back as I was sent to the visa desk and they figured out what to do with me.  </p>

<p>&#8211;You’re too dumb to be a Frenchman my superior said after weeks on the desk. But Moscow believes you might make a good painter.  </p>

<p>I again boarded the Soviet plane and headed to Russia. This time I was trained to be a Polish painter obsessed with abstract art. The Americans were sending a cultural delegation in six months time to Krakow and it was hoped I could ingratiate myself into the group and be selected to travel back with them.  </p>

<p>&#8211;But I can’t paint a circle, I told the instructors at the Bureau of Iconography.  </p>

<p>&#8211;Nonsense they said. Come this way.  </p>

<p>The institute was in a converted wartime air hanger. We walked through an open workshop where giant statues of Stalin were being assembled.  I looked up agog at the massive lighting rigs that covered the ceiling. A strip of black fabric fell gently down and onto my face. I turned around and saw workers rising and falling on wires in front of a three-story banner of Lenin’s glare.  They were surging the edges and cutting off the excess black velvet trim.  </p>

<p>&#8211;Come this way Danzig.   </p>

<p>We walked up a stairs and along a catwalk to a wooden door. The director of iconography opened it up and inside was a light drenched workroom. On the wall were jazz and boxing posters. There were decanters of expensive scotch and a cheap bathtub. Everywhere was paint and canvases full of paint, but to my eyes, no images.  </p>

<p>&#8211;This is a village studio, the director said.  You will sleep here and learn the lifestyle of an artist. These paintings are replicas of the corrupt empty art popular in the capitalist west now.  As you can see, they appear the work of a halfwit child. This decadent stage in western culture is a rare opportunity for an agent to insert himself with the minimum of training. Here you will paint during the day and in the evening you will be taken to the Lubyanka and study at the American Culture Archives. You are now the painter Tadeusz Danzig. Lover of all things American. Potential defector.  </p>

<p>The painting was miserable and boring. Dripping paint aimlessly like a moron! What sickness befalls America, I asked the director.  </p>

<p>To relax I would make shapes on the canvas and, when no one was looking, I would add perspective to make houses, or write down a dirty joke and then paint over. </p>

<p>Then, the director of iconography caught me making images instead of abstract capitalist madness.  He said that given the imminence of my Krakow exhibition for the American delegation, expertly made cover paintings would have to be sent over instead of my own. </p>

<p>&#8211;You should go now for your cultural training Danzig.  </p>

<p>For the all the torture that was my studio practice, studying at the American Culture Archives at KGB headquarters was a reward and I hoped that my access there would not be suspended because of my lack of an ability to resist object based art.  </p>

<p>In the deepest recesses of the Lubyanka I had already tasted Coca Cola and, along with several other agents, been taught American folk dances such as the Slop, the Walk, and the Bop. We watched youth documentaries like The Blackboard Jungle that were translated live by the instructor into a megaphone at the back of the classroom.  </p>

<p>&#8211;See radical students refuse balm of capitalism indoctrination, he yelled. See how they rock until the clock strikes four and see how they yell for more.  </p>

<p>I soon admitted that I was confused by the two streams of training—high art and low culture— until it was explained that this new way of painting and this new way of slopping, walking and bopping, came out of the same desire to resist the forces of history.   This newness was an illusion, my American culture instructor said. A false consciousness. </p>

<p>One night we watched a filmed performance by Elvis Presley in the classroom. All the KGB colonels were in attendance, smoking their terrible Russian cigarettes. They were rock still in their green suits but Presley was pure motion on the screen, like the Futurist canvases I had studied recently. The American’s back and forth violence caught the shifting cigarette smoke in front of the projector.  Yes, he very much seemed like an illusion but I couldn’t think of what was wrong with an illusion. There were worse things, I decided, than having a false consciousness and doing the Slop, the Walk, and the Bop.  </p>

<p>After being driven back to the hanger I loped across the concrete floor, empty after quitting time and stood alone with a Stalin statue, big as that Godzilla thing in the film we had been shown as an example of pacifist propaganda. I imagined Stalin biting a train in half and laughed to myself.  </p>

<p>At my feet I found a large square of the black velvet that was cut away from the Lenin banner. I picked it up and tucked it close as I ran along the catwalk back to my studio room. There I stretched the fabric across a wooden frame and secured it with thumbtacks as I was trained to do. </p>

<p>I took a palette from the sink and squirted oil globs, and then fanned a brush into it. On the canvas I started forming a face with pouting lips. Painting onto a negative surface I discovered that depth was a cinch as American teenagers say with finger snaps. Even the singer’s hair, black as sturgeon caviar, could be rendered on the velvet with the minimum of white highlights and a thin brush. </p>

<p>I had painted an illusion, so I knew I would have to burn it before morning.  </p>
