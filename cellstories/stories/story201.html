		</p><p>“Frank?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Bruce?”</p>

<p>      “No?”</p>

<p>      “Chuck?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Todd?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “James?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Jim?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Jimmy?” </p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>“So this was an oral contract?”</p>

<p>      “Yeah.”</p>

<p>      “Nothing written? No paper trail?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Letters? Receipts? Cocktail napkins with scribbled—”</p>

<p>      “No, no. Nothing like that. It was real informal.”</p>

<p>      “Okay. So then it’s basically your word against his.”</p>

<p>      “Yeah.”</p>

<p>      “That’s good. We can . . . that’s helpful.”</p>

<p>      “It is? Oh thank God. So you think you—”</p>

<p>      “Except—the Little Guy, he can still spin straw into gold?”</p>

<p>      “As far as I know.”</p>

<p>      “So he’s going to be able to afford a real bang-up legal team, then. Bobby Zabrewski. Whit Goldstein. Freddie the Swede.”</p>

<p>      “Freddie the who?”</p>

<p>      “The Swede. Sneaky sonofabitch. Won $20 million in punitive damages for some dumbass emperor duped into buying invisible clothes.”</p>

<p>      “$20 million?”</p>

<p>      “Fraud, breach of contract, mental anguish, public humiliation.”</p>

<p>      “Wow.”</p>

<p>      “Yep. Slimy as a sheep frog. But sharp. $20 million.”</p>

<p>      “That’s just—I can’t believe— ”</p>

<p>      “Yep, the Little Guy’s gonna hire the Swede for sure.”</p>

<p>      “. . .”</p>

<p>      “So how are you and Petey doing with that list of names?” </p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>“Joseph?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Joey?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “José?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Yusuf?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Giuseppe?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “João?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Jo-Jo?” </p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>“So what does the King think about all this?”</p>

<p>      “. . .”</p>

<p>      “I mean, doesn’t he—”</p>

<p>      “The King doesn’t know.”</p>

<p>      “. . . You’re kidding me. So you haven’t—”</p>

<p>      “You think I want the King all up in my business?”</p>

<p>      “But—”</p>

<p>      “Knowing I ain’t worth a damn? That some midget has dibs on my firstborn?”</p>

<p>      “But—”</p>

<p>      “That my dumbass daddy was just blowing smoke about me and straw and gold? No. Petey knows and now you know. But no one else. Okay? Christ, Tom. The King catches wind of this, and I’m dropped like a sack of rocks.”</p>

<p>      “Okay, okay.”</p>

<p>      “The King, Tom. The King. Same King who threatened to kill me.”</p>

<p>      “Yeah, but you’re queen now, I’m sure that’s all water under the—”</p>

<p>      “Of course I bring that up now, you think he apologizes? Gets down on bended knee? Hell no. He acts like it never happened. Like he never scared me shitless. Like he never locked me in that cellar, with that straw, and that spinning wheel, and told me if it wasn’t twenty-four karats—”</p>

<p>      “Alright. Understood. I got you. So if you want to keep this under wraps, then maybe we should consider arbitration.”</p>

<p>      “. . . Arbi-what?”</p>

<p>      “Arbitration. We get a third party to help you and the Little Guy reach an agreement. Keep this out of the courts. Off the public record. Away from the Swede.”</p>

<p>      “And that’s . . . allowed?”</p>

<p>      “Sure, sure. People arbitrate all the time. Quicker. Cheaper. Easier. Typically.”</p>

<p>      “And you think we’d win?”</p>

<p>      “Well, the perfect scenario is—you’d both win. You know, compromise. That’s what you’re shooting for, ideally, with arbitration.”</p>

<p>      “I don’t see how we both win.”</p>

<p>      “Of course, not every scenario is a perfect scenario.”</p>

<p>      “Straw into gold. My dumbass daddy.” </p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>“Phil?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Hank?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Lester.”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Chet?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Skip?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Mahershalalhashbaz?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Doug?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Stu?” </p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>“You think maybe you already guessed his name?”</p>

<p>      “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>      “Say his name is Stan. And you say, ‘Stan?’ What’s to stop him from saying, ‘No’?”</p>

<p>      “Stan . . . Stan . . . have I tried that one yet?”</p>

<p>      “But you see what I’m saying, right? Unless we want to risk him fleecing us, stringing us along, there needs to be some third-party oversight. Some outside verification.”</p>

<p>      “The Little Guy ain’t going to cotton to that.”</p>

<p>      “We arbitrate, maybe he cottons.”</p>

<p>      “He ain’t going to cotton.”</p>

<p>      “You’re being negative again.”</p>

<p>      “Oh for Christ’s—”</p>

<p>      “And I understand, angel, I understand your negativity. All you’ve been hearing lately is no, no, no, no, no, no, no. But it only takes one yes. One. Remember that.”</p>

<p>      “Aw, Tom, you’re so goddamn sappy.”</p>

<p>      “C’mere.”</p>

<p>      “Aw, Tom—”</p>

<p>      “. . .”</p>

<p>      “You know, come to think of it, I haven’t tried Stan yet. Or Stanley. Or . . . what else?”</p>

<p>      “Stanton. Stanwood. Standish. Stanislaus. Stanford.”</p>

<p>      “Stanford? That’s a— ”</p>

<p>      “Also Standford, Stamford, Stanfield, Stansfield.”</p>

<p>“Oh Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p>“Hey, that’s a good one. Write that one down.” </p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>“Godfrey?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Godwin?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Goddard?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Godthaab?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Godin?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Godet?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Godot?” </p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>“My daddy’s always been ashamed of me.”</p>

<p>      “That’s not true.”</p>

<p>      “He has. Thinks I ain’t worth a damn, so to save face he tells all those lies. ‘Oh, your daughter can play the lute? My daughter invented the lute.’ ‘Oh, your daughter is studying medicine? My daughter raised a family of four from the dead.’ ‘Oh, your daughter made you a charm bracelet out of macramé? My daughter can spin straw into gold.’”</p>

<p>      “That’s a reflection on him. Not you.”</p>

<p>      “A miller’s daughter. That’s all I was supposed to be. And now I’m queen but to tell you the truth I feel even less . . . I mean, my daddy’s right, I ain’t worth—”</p>

<p>      “Come on, you know that’s not—”</p>

<p>      “Craziest thing is since we got married the King’s never once asked me to so much as touch a spinning wheel. Like after the initial thrill of that cellar-full of gold wore off, he got bored or something. He gets bored easily, the King. Was all gung-ho about having the kid—heir to the throne, preserving his line, spreading his seed, etc.—but since I gave birth he’s barely seen the girl. I know he wanted a son, but—”</p>

<p>      “Angel, listen to me. You are so—”</p>

<p>      “I’m not stupid. I know what they write about me in the magazines. Hark! Ladies in Waiting. The Fairest of Them All. You know where they ranked me on ‘The Monarchy’s 35 Best and Worst Beach Bodies’? You know what they say about the King and that pale hussy dating Prince Charming?”</p>

<p>      “Aw, nobody takes those rags—”</p>

<p>      “And you keep telling me this whole arbitration thing’ll be kept confidential. But what if the Little Guy leaks to the media? Huh? You ever think of that?”</p>

<p>      “Look, if you’re going to worry about every little—”</p>

<p>      “Aw, Christ. Those peckerheads’ll have a field day.”</p>

<p>      “Okay. Calm down. Relax. Take a deep breath. I say, what we focus on now is preemptive action. Meaning, you guess the Little Guy’s name, and we don’t have to worry about arbitration, or the magazines, or any of that. Right?”</p>

<p>      “Yeah, I guess, but—”</p>

<p>      “Right. So, first, tell me everything you know about this guy. Where’s he from? Does he have any family? What are his interests? Where does he hang out?”</p>

<p>      “I don’t know anything. I mean, I know what he looks like. Late fifties. Beard. Stupid hat. Pointy shoes. Four, maybe four-and-a-quarter feet tall. From his accent, I’d say he’s from out east. Smells funny. Sometimes talks in rhyme. Not a looker. Does any of this help?”</p>

<p>      “Maybe, maybe. Find Petey, tell him everything you know, be as specific as possible, and who knows? Maybe Petey finds something.”</p>

<p>      “How is Petey doing, anyway, on the list?”</p>

<p>      “Last I checked, he was one-third of the way through the census records. Found some real good ones, too.”</p>

<p>      “Such as?”</p>

<p>      “Llywellyn. Ríoghbhardán. A'amakualenalena. Shoemowetochawcawewahcatowe.”</p>

<p>      “We’re never gonna guess that little bastard’s name.” </p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>“Richard?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Richard, Jr.?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Richard, Sr.?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Richard I?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Richard II”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Richard III?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Richard {all integers ³ 4}?”  </p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>“It’s not like I really ever loved him.”</p>

<p>      “I know that.”</p>

<p>      “This is a man who wanted to kill me, remember?”</p>

<p>      “Yep, I do.”</p>

<p>      “But when you’re just this little peasant girl, and the King asks you to marry him  . . . and you know how I wanted to get away from my daddy.”</p>

<p>      “It’s okay, angel. You don’t have to explain yourself to me.”</p>

<p>      “And as for conceiving the kid, believe me, that was far from romantic. God. It was nothing like—”</p>

<p>      “Really, it’s okay.”</p>

<p>      “But I love the kid, of course, how could I not? Her little nose, little hands, little feet, little mouth, little—”</p>

<p>      “Look, you’re going to keep her. Okay? I promise. No way am I going to—”</p>

<p>      “This past year has been so strange. So confusing.”</p>

<p>      “It’s been a confusing time for everyone.”</p>

<p>      “Just looking back, from the first day my daddy met with the King, nothing makes any sense. I mean, I can sort of understand why he said I could spin straw into gold. He was trying to butter up the King, like he butters up everybody. Daddy’s always been a liar. But then when the King locked me in that cellar, said he was going to hang me if I didn’t prove my daddy right, why didn’t my daddy admit he was lying? Why did he leave me in there to die? He knew I wasn’t worth a damn with a spinning wheel. Or did he not? Did he maybe convince himself . . . do you think, all this time, he’s believed every one of his own—”</p>

<p>      “I don’t know. Why don’t you ask him?”</p>

<p>      “And as for the King—who threatens to kill some poor peasant girl because her daddy’s a liar? Right? Talk about cruel and unusual. And then, better yet, after she turns him a massive profit with his excess straw, thinks to himself—Hey, this chick’s not so bad after all. Maybe I should ask her to marry me. I’ll bet she’ll have no hard feelings about me locking her up in my musty cellar for three straight days and putting the hangman on call for her execution.”</p>

<p>      “But you did marry him.”</p>

<p>      “Right, I thought I just explained—”</p>

<p>      “Angel, c’mere.”</p>

<p>      “And they say men are logical, women are illogical. Yeah. Right. And as for the Little Guy—okay, if he asked me to screw him, that I could understand, but he asks for my firstborn child? And he knows I have to say yes; the King’s going to kill me, what else can I say? And then this whole name thing . . . I’ll bet it ends up being a complete cop-out, like his name is an unpronounceable symbol or something, or it has an accented vowel I didn’t emphasize quite right. God, I could just kill that little—”</p>

<p>      “Petey thinks his name starts with R.”</p>

<p>      “. . .”</p>

<p>      “Said he saw him outside the Gruel and Brew. The Little Guy. Tanked. He kept muttering to himself. Kept referring to himself in the first person. Petey swears it was him. Says the Little Guy called himself the ‘R-Dog.’”</p>

<p>      “. . . The R-Dog?”</p>

<p>      “You know, like, someone’s name is Sam, and all his friends call him the ‘S-Man.’ Or a guy’s name is Polonius, and all his pals call him ‘Master P.’”</p>

<p>      “And Petey is sure it was the Little Guy?”</p>

<p>      “He’s positive. Said the Little Guy was like, ‘R-Dog’s on the prowl! R-Dog’s gonna get him some tail! Ladies watch out for the R-Dog!’”</p>

<p>      “He was just hanging out in front of Gruel and Brew?”</p>

<p>      “Apparently. ’Til security kicked him out. Petey said the R-Dog got pretty lewd by around nine-thirty. I mean, with his body mass, one ale’s got to just about—”</p>

<p>      “The R-Dog. Huh.”</p>

<p>      “I think we can guess it, by the end of day three. Petey’s compiling all the R names he can think of, as we speak. Real trooper, Petey. Hasn’t slept since Thursday.”</p>

<p>      “Reggie. Ricky. Raymond, maybe? He doesn’t really look like a Raymond.”</p>

<p>      “We got this, angel. We got this S.O.B.”</p>

<p>      “‘R-Dog’s on the prowl. Ladies watch out for the R-Dog.’”

<br><h4>***</h4></p><p>“Ridley?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Ramsay?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Randy?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Ray?”</p>

<p>      “No.”</p>

<p>      “Ray-Ray?” </p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>“But what really gets me, more than anything else, is the not knowing. So much, riding on a guess. It’s making me . . . I just feel crazy.”</p>

<p>      “Petey’s got some good leads. I’m sure, by morning, he’ll—”</p>

<p>      “It’s just so . . . what’s the word? . . . arbitrary. But that’s how life is, right? This one’s poor, that one’s rich. This one lives, that one dies. This one loves you, that one—”</p>

<p>      “Why don’t you get some sleep? You’ve got to be exhausted. By morning, trust me, everything will—”</p>

<p>      “I’m tired of guessing. I want to . . . know, you know?”</p>

<p>      “You’ve done all you can. Petey and I will—”</p>

<p>      “I remember thinking, when I was a little girl, that there was a reason for everything. An order. That everything could be explained. I’d ask my daddy what thunder was, and he’d say, ‘It’s the angels bowling.’ I’d ask him where rain came from, and he’d say, ‘It’s the angels crying.’ Everything I asked, he answered. But then I got older, and I realized my daddy didn’t know his ass from his elbow. He didn’t know his ass from a hole in the ground. For years, I had imagined the angels up in heaven weeping every time they failed to convert a spare or bowl a strike, and then, one day, it dawned on me—that makes absolutely no sense. None. Bawling, bowling angels? Yeah. Right. And soon enough, upon further review, everything else my daddy told me fell apart. As well as everything my friends told me, my daddy’s friends told me; my neighbors, the nuns, the vicars. I finally realized almost everything everyone says makes no sense. Almost everything everyone does makes no sense. Read the magazines. ‘Kissing the Right Frog: 20 Tips on Finding Prince Charming.’ ‘Cinderella’s Dark Secret Exposed: Coachman is Rat, Coach is Pumpkin.’ ‘Don’t Eat That House!: Hansel and Gretel’s Can’t-Miss Consumer Report.’ We live in a world composed of senselessness.”</p>

<p>      “. . .”</p>

<p>      “And what if I do guess it? Huh? What happens then?”</p>

<p>      “. . . Meaning?”</p>

<p>      “You and me?”</p>

<p>      “. . .”</p>
