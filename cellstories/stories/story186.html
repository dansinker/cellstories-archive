<h2>They Watch TV in Heaven</h2>
	<h3>Jason D. Smith</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>Toby Charleston woke up on his seventh birthday and knew exactly what he had to do to bring his mom back down from Heaven. He had heard that TV came from outer space and that Heaven was in outer space, so all he had to do was get on TV and simply show his mom the way back home.  </p>

<p>Toby knew that in order to reach space and Heaven, he would have to talk into a camera like news-people do. He was sure that if he did something interesting enough on camera, his mom would see it in Heaven; she loved TV. Toby remembered watching television with his mom, and how much she liked a guy named Joey Chestnut. Joey Chestnut was and is the world champion of competitive hot dog eating. Flipping through the channels, Toby and his Mom were startled by the image of a man shoving hot dogs in his mouth as fast as he could. They had never seen anything like it. He would first eat the dogs two at a time, chomping them down into sections and swallowing without chewing. Then he dunked the buns in a big cup of water and stuffed the soggy bread into his mouth. Behind Joey was a busty woman in a bikini, holding a giant flip chart of numbers. She was flipping the pages of the chart, and the numbers grew: 27... 28 ... 29 ... Toby was in awe, the crowd chanted, and Toby's Mom yelled, "I think I'm in love!" Toby knew that if he did what Joey did on TV that day, that his mom would see it for sure, and she could find her way home. </p>

<p>So Toby built a satellite out of cardboard, paper plates, and tin foil. Then a video camera out of a shoebox and a kaleidoscope. He tested it, made sure that it recorded properly, stroked his chin like scientists do, and moved on.  </p>

<p>He had asked his friend, the Olympic women’s volleyball player Shelly, for help. She had started showing up out of the blue after the Olympics ended in the summer of '08. On hot days she appeared wearing a sporty black swimsuit and wrap-around sunglasses, with a volleyball under one arm. They usually played Space Pirates and Ice Age Animals together, but she was up for a change of pace. Toby knew she would be perfect for the job because she could outrun anybody, and fight people off by spiking volleyballs.  </p>

<p>Toby's Dad had invited the neighbors over for a barbecue in Toby's name. Nobody brought presents, just beer. Ever since Mom left for heaven two birthdays ago, Toby's birthday became an excuse for his dad to throw a party without any balloons or birthday cake. Toby and Shelly had snuck past the adults huddled around a cooler of beer, swiped a hot dog tray from a picnic table, and made a run for it. Toby instructed Shelly to spike volley balls into the faces of anybody who tried to stop them, even his dad. They ran past the sliding door to the kitchen, into the bushes against the house, and then emerged at the side of the house, where Toby had set up his satellite and camera. There, they were halted by Vince, Toby's testosterone-confused brother. He was in the middle of sitting on the chest of Toby's younger cousin, Patrick, forcing him to eat ladybugs. Around them, bits of tin foil glinted in the harsh summer sun - the satellite and camera were ruined. “Spike him with volleyballs, Shelly! Spike him!” Toby yelled with tears and rage. His plan was ruined.  
<br> 
<br>Vince got up from Patrick’s chest and turned to Toby. Toby held the tray of hot dogs, waiting for his brother to be pelted by a barrage of volleyballs. He imagined hundreds of striped balls smashing into his brother’s face, knocking him over, turning his stocky profile into a purple and red lumpy mass. But nothing happened, and Toby looked around to find that Shelly was gone.  </p>

<p>“What the hell do you want, Marshmallow?” Vince boomed. He played football, and his barrel chest seemed to amplify his voice like he was talking into an oil drum. Vince looked down at the tray of hot dogs. “Those are the dogs Dad grilled, aren’t they?” Toby stood, listless. Patrick got up from the grass while spitting out lady-bug wings, then ran back to the adults while he still had the chance.  </p>

<p>“Awww, I’m gonna tell on you!” Vince started to suck in a deep breath, like he was about to blow out candles on a birthday cake. Vince would always tell on Toby by screaming, “DAAAAAAD!” at the top of his lungs. </p>

<p>Dad was like a troll. He liked watching baseball and drinking beer and sat in his chair, doing what he liked until Toby got himself in trouble. Dad would appear, red in the face, clenching his belt. He would bare his teeth and hunch over, his shoulders hitting the ceiling. If Toby was lucky, he could dart under his dad’s tall legs and make a run for it. Toby's Dad would always pursue him, turning it into a sick game. Swinging wildly, Dad would use his belt like a whip, smashing lamps and punching holes in the walls, trying to make contact with Toby’s skin. Toby always ran to the “sick room,” where his mom used to sleep while fighting off the cancer. Dad never stepped foot in Mom’s old room, and it was the only place that was safe other than school.  </p>

<p>Right before Vince could call for Dad, Toby yelled “STOP!” He knew his plan was ruined and that Mom wouldn't be home for his birthday. But anything was better than agitating his dad. "Please," Toby said in a defeated tone. Vince cracked an evil smile. He looked like a snake, or the creepy mail man that liked to watch Toby play in the front yard. “Why …?” </p>

<p>“I want to show you something..." Toby had to think quick,"...I bet I can do something you can’t do.” Vince did not like this; he could do anything that “Tubby Toby” could do. “No way! You’re dead meat,” Vince said, and started taking a deep breath again.  </p>

<p>“No! Please, Vince, please!” Toby said, tugging at the collar of his shirt. He couldn’t stand the thought of Dad cornering him again. His arms and chest were still stinging from yesterday. He had only spilled orange juice at breakfast. There was no telling what his reaction would be if Toby was caught with the hot dogs. Toby had to do something, anything. So he plopped down onto the prickly summer grass, tray in his lap, and started eating - just like Joey Chestnut. </p>

<p>Toby grabbed two hot dogs, first eating the dogs, then dipping the buns into a cup of water and shoving the waterlogged bread in his mouth. Another two, and another two, and another. Vince was frozen in awe of the spectacle. Bun oozed out of the corners of Toby’s mouth, and Vince laughed out of his barrel chest. Toby felt like he was on stage. He could hear a crowd cheering for him and he could even hear his mom cheering and he thought maybe she would find her way home and maybe he could get away from Vince and his dad and they could watch TV together like they used to - and the hot dogs were gone. Toby emptied the tray, and he felt nowhere near his mom.  </p>

<p>Hulking over Toby, Vince was not sure of what he just saw, but he knew that it was something he couldn’t do. Vince grabbed Toby by the collar of his blue and white striped shirt, lifted him up from the grass, and wrenched the fabric until Toby's face turned red. </p>

<p>“You’re such a loser, who cares if you can eat a bunch of hot dogs. Everyone knows that lardy little kids like you are good at eating.”  </p>

<p>And with that said, Vince punched Toby in the stomach. Toby staggered back from Vince's grasp, doubling over and gasping for air. It was too much, Toby could not hold back the tears, or the hot dogs, and puked. Bits of hot dog, bun and bile first shot, then rolled out of his mouth, dampening the sun-scorched grass, soiling his shirt, and spattering on his tennis shoes. After heaving several times, Toby remembered a time when he was sick and his mom rubbed his back while he puked in the toilet. Something about the cool toilet seat against his cheek and his mom’s hands running up and down his spine was comforting.  </p>

<p>"Dad's going to kill you!" Vince said, walking back to the adults.  </p>

<p>Toby needed get back to his room. At the side of the house, the basement had a small and narrow window. Toby could open the window and slide feet first on his stomach, squeeze through and drop down into the basement. He knew that this would be the fastest way inside without his dad noticing. 
<br>Toby dropped down into the basement.  </p>

<p>Winding his way through vine-like tangles of tubes, he felt his mother’s old clothes hanging over him like Spanish moss on branches made of metal. He squeezed pass the wash pan he used to give her baths with, and snuck past the machine that used to help her breathe. He was afraid that if he bumped into it, it would turn on and start pumping air, alerting his dad. Toby wasn't allowed down here, and his dad only came down when he was drinking. Climbing the stairs of the basement, Toby tripped on over a pillow, reminding him of a time when he was laying in the bed with his mom, right before she left for heaven. She tickled Toby’s pudgy stomach, and stuck her finger in his belly button and called him “Mommy’s little munchkin.” When Toby got scared, like he was now, he would snake his hand up his shirt, and put his finger in his belly button. He even remembered not to bite one of his fingernails, so that it felt like his mom’s finger poking him.  </p>

<p>In his room, Toby took his soiled shirt off and lay on his bed, shirtless. Rolling onto his back, he listened to the sounds of the barbeque coming through an open window, where his dad could be heard. </p>

<p>"God damn it!" the words shot through Toby's window like a rouge baseball. His voice became muffled and inaudible until his it rose again, "Toby did what?"  </p>

<p>Toby sat up in bed with wide eyes; he could hear his dad come into the house. The sliding glass door was flung open, shaking the walls. A heavy stride could be heard through the kitchen, through the living room, up to the landing to the stairs. "Toby! Get your ass out here!" Before Toby could move, his dad started thundering up the stairs. Sitting up in bed, Toby waited for the door to be breached. He watched the Velcro dart board on his door shudder with every step up the stairs. The door flung open with such force that its handle punched through the wall. Toby thought about clamoring out the window, or hiding under his bed. Instead he just curled up and waited for the belt.  </p>

<p>“Everything OK up there, Red?” a voice called from downstairs. Dad froze. Alcohol fumes bellowed out of his mouth, and his eyes were wide and made of coal. He could explode any second. Everything about him was combustible. </p>

<p>“Red? Red! Get back down here! There’s a beer waiting for ya!”  </p>

<p>Red glanced behind him, then back at Toby. “I’ll deal with this later. Don’t you dare leave this room.” He turned and left, slamming the door. Toby sat, frozen in his bed, and listened to make sure his dad was heading back to the party. The stairs creaked, a beer was opened, the sliding door closed. Safe. </p>

<p>Toby crawled under his covers and poked at his belly button with his long finger-nail. He began to wonder what his mom watched on TV while in Heaven. He imagined her sitting on a couch made of clouds and pictured her brown hair turned a golden blond. She had angels’ wings, and they would splay outwards when she stretched her arms during commercials, like she always did when she was here. She ate popcorn out of the bag and ice cream out of the tub, being careful not to dirty her feathers. More than anything, Toby wanted to be there next to his Mom, her arm wrapped around his shoulders, away from his dad, watching whatever they watch in Heaven. </p>
