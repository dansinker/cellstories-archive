<h2>Late-Night Love</h2>
	<h3>Dmitry Samarov</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p><h4>Street Meat</h4></p><p>He flagged me down in Old Town, a pipsqueek of a man wearing thick glasses. We headed west on North Avenue and he asked whether the hookers still hung out here. "I used to get blown for $20 by the underpass. Me and my buddies used to call 'em 'Street Meat,'" he said proudly, as if he'd coined the term. "They've really cleaned it up around here," this last with regret in his voice. When told that most Yuppies preferred to be serviced at home these days, he protested that he liked to get his off the side of the road. He paid and ran across the street to an upscale nightspot. 
<br> 
<br> A tiny Asian girl got in at 3AM in Ukrainian Village, headed Downtown. She listed the services that she would and wouldn't perform to someone on the receiving end of her cell. "I'm a nursing student, No, I'm on my way to a date now, wanna meet later? What do you look like?" She got out at a big apartment building with a doorman, near the lake. 
<br> 
<br> Girls of all sizes and shapes call to be taken to work at VIPs or the Admiral, the last two strip clubs in the city. They're usually silent during the ride, steeling themselves perhaps for the night ahead. Hard to be friendly when you have to fake it for hours on end. The Admiral offers free admission to cabdrivers, as well as a $10 bonus for steering customers their way. The two professions seem linked in some way, especially for out-of-towners. They think that we have stables of willing ladies just waiting to help them cheat on their wives. 
<br> 
<br> On the West Side in the middle of a snowstorm, she was so grateful to finally get a cab. A young, heavily made-up Latina, she wanted to go to the Belden-Stratford, a posh old residential hotel in Lincoln Park. There was no pretense here--she told me how badly she needed the money. The guy was a repeat customer. She sympathized with me, having to be out in this mess. We pulled into the drive and shortly after, an obese older gentleman in a robe came out, paid the fare and escorted her inside. 
<br> 
<br><h4>Modesty</h4></p><p>5AM and the two of them were the last outside the bar's locked doors. "Your place?" he asked her as they got in. The Lincoln Park address she offered made him ask, "You live there?" 
<br> 
<br>Whether they'd met at the last watering hole or at the one just before that, they made an odd pair. She was made up and wore clothes that had obviously set her back something, whereas he was a scrawny, bespectacled, hipster type. The need to warm another's bed had bridged the class and culture chasm once more. 
<br> 
<br>"I get it," she said. "Ever since I got to this town, the guys I've dated have been infatuated with who I am." Eliciting no more than murmured assent, she continued: "I've always been the best at anything I've ever tried, Oh Yeah, I was the Homecoming Queen. I'm passionate about everything I do, my sisters were model-gorgeous, in beauty contests, so I'm all about competing and getting what I want." 
<br> 
<br>All through her soliloquy, he cowered closer and closer to the window, present in body but edging toward flight. As we pulled into the high-rise's drive, he went out without a word and loitered uncertainly by the glass doors. "My little boyfriend's allergic to paying his way--a real winner!" she said, as she dug the MasterCard from her purse. She bolted inside, high-fiving the doorman; he followed sheepishly in her wake, undoubtedly thrilled to spend the night with God's Gift to Men. 
<br> 
<br><h4>Marriage</h4></p><p>She dwarfed him by a good foot or so, yet he steered her down the steps and into the back seat with practiced efficiency. "She's going to 22nd Place and Western," he said, looking hard to be sure that she was delivered there safely. 
<br> 
<br>"Where are we?", she asks, looking out the window at the deserted early-morning street. Reassured of our location as well as the destination seems to ease her a bit, though a few minutes later she wonders how long it'll be 'til she's home. "He wanted me to spend the night, but I gotta go to church in the morning. He always does, he don't understand, I have no one except my pastor. If I don't come, he'll wonder what's wrong and the next time he'll lecture me..." 
<br> 
<br>"I'm so sorry I've been drinking and you don't wanna do this... He told me that if I get in the cab, it's over." Nearing her house, she repeated these things until the tears began to flow and in front of the gate it was clear the burden had not yet been lifted; the engine idled and she kept asking questions to which her driver had no answers. 
<br> 
<br>"I want to marry him so much but he won't go into the church--doesn't believe in it. What can I do? You don't know me and don't care about me and this shit, so what do you think I should do? Thank you so much for taking me home, I know you didn't want to..." Her tear-stained face was right up to the open partition, darkly lacquered nails reflecting the street lights as her hand rested on the runner of the sliding window; threatening the established distance needed to convey customers to their desired destinations without being dragged along in their wake. Without that barrier, the line is blurred further than the typical alcohol-aided intimacy of a Saturday night. 
<br> 
<br>"I love him but he won't agree to it. The church is all I got. I'll wake up in two hours and go. Will you please wait until I get inside my house?" 
<br>She balanced one uncertain foot after the other through the metal gate, then to the door and in, waving her hand and disappearing into the unlit house. 
<br> 
<br><h4>Deluge</h4></p><p>I pulled up to the 7-11, driving a guy on a mission to get Ben & Jerry's. Lightening lit up the night as rain alternated with hail, pelting the cab and making visibility barely a hope. The couple stood cowering in the doorway obviously stranded by the deluge. I rolled the window down enough to tell'em I'd be back, as my fare was only going a couple blocks further. 
<br> 
<br>Maneuvering around downed lightpoles and trees through newly formed lakes and back to that store; they huddled together as before. His stop was first and they kissed for a minute or two before he ran to his door. </p>

<p>She apologized for the necking as we pulled away, to which I replied that as long as the backseat was left as they'd found it, there was no problem. First Date? Of course it was. They'd remember it too, as the day the sky fell to earth. 
<br> 
<br>She'd known him for three years and suspected that they'd both harbored a secret crush for that long. She'd been reading a Russian novel called <i>Three Seconds' Silence</i> about a sailor in a storm. This inspired her that day to bite the bullet and ask him out.</p>

<p>Without turning back to look, it was obvious that she was glowing; it had gone so much better than she'd imagined. "We were wondering if we'd even make it home, could've stayed in front of the 7-11, making out all night."
<br> 
<br>She paid and ran across Halsted to her place. I went on, through blacked-out city blocks, with windshield wipers failing to keep up, squealing sounds issuing from the soaked undercarriage of the cab, the night a bit brighter despite all evidence to the contrary. </p>
