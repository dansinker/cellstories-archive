<h2>Cortez the Killer</h2>
	<h3>Ben Anderson</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>  I started worrying when Cortez wouldn’t eat. Mary said I must have changed something, the routine, and whatever I did threw him off. She told me snakes are fragile animals. They need care and love and a strict regimen. A strict regimen was crucial. She told me I screwed up the feeding ritual. Now Cortez wouldn’t eat and it was all my fault.</p>

<p>      I knew better . Mary didn’t know a fucking thing about pythons. Neither did I, but that wasn’t the point. I just knew she was wrong. Cortez had been part of the family for 14 years and in all that time he always ate. </p>

<p>      I liked playing games with Cortez. The lady breeder that we bought him from suggested pre-killed prey.  She informed us that live prey could hurt a python, especially rats, but even a mouse could inflict damage if the snake wasn’t quick enough. But I knew better. I could tell our guy was a killer.</p>

<p>      Some nights after work I’d dangle a mouse by it’s pink earthworm tail and imagine it was my boss.</p>

<p>      Fuck you, Tom. I told you I needed the weekend off.</p>

<p>      And sometimes after a fight I’d feed Mary to the snake and feel better.</p>

<p>      Cortez ate like a prizefighter. It was a beautiful, wordless thing whenever I’d drop a fat mouse into the aquarium and watch it run horrified into each glass corner. Sometimes a mouse stood face to face with Cortez and sniffed—most knew better. Soon Cortez came dancing across the sawdust from his little shack—a plastic crate with a hole cut in the front—and watched the mouse like an old friend. That’s how I knew he was a killer. No indication of the oncoming feast, no hint or sound, just a cold stare. And before any of us knew it, the mouse was stuck in Cortez’s mouth, its fat pink tail waving at me. Cortez embraced his mice and snapped the life out of them. Just like that and the mouse was dead. Just a cold snap.</p>

<p>      We both loved Cortez, me more so than Mary. She loved him too, I guess, but he was my snake and she never really wanted him in the first place. When he finally got big, I started setting him loose around the house. At first Mary hated seeing him cut through the living room, but he became like any other pet. Sure, Mary still tensed up whenever he brushed against her leg or popped around a corner without warning, but she was a tough lady. She could deal with fear and didn’t complain too much about the snake. She had other things to complain about anyway.</p>

<p>      But when Cortez stopped eating we were both concerned.</p>

<p>      “I just can’t guess the problem,” Mary said. “Maybe we should switch to pre-killed mice?” </p>

<p>      “What’s the point?” I finished my cup of coffee and studied the sink. Piles of dishes jutted from the dirty water. A couple bloated fries floated around like corpses. I needed a drink and wanted Mary to leave me alone so I could fetch my whisky bottle. She hated seeing me drink before work even though I half expect she did the same.</p>

<p>      “What do you mean?” she said. Her mouth hung slightly open. “What do you mean? If he eats, that’s the point. What do you mean, ‘what’s the point?’”</p>

<p>      She didn’t understand that I loved the kills. I’m not violent or twisted, but Cortez landed so many beautiful, one-hit knockouts . You can’t find that stuff anywhere else. And besides, Cortez’s morale would dip if he ate dead things. How couldn’t it? The snake would be a fucking eunuch.</p>

<p>      I said, “I just don’t think that’s the problem. That’s all I meant.”</p>

<p>      She couldn’t stomach the feedings. She only watched once and then threw up in the bathroom afterwards. She sympathized with the mouse, and I sympathized with the snake.</p>

<p>      “Then what is the problem?” She dropped her bowl into the sink.</p>

<p>      “I don’t know.”</p>

<p>      Soon she left for the post office where she worked as a mail clerk sorting letters into the appropriate bins. She hated the job but couldn’t find anything else without an education. A government job is a government job I always told her. Personal security and pensions and benefits. She didn’t seem to care about the benefits. The job was killing her but  I didn’t care. My job was killing me too but I didn’t make a big deal about it, so I went to the computer room and took my bottle of whisky from its spot beneath the desk. I took a shot from the bottle and put it back. Mary wasn’t cut out for work. She should have married a doctor—someone with money. She’d rather read a book.</p>

<p>      I took a shower but didn’t wash my hair. Downstairs I cut away at my beard with the kitchen’s meat scissors because a beard trimming kit seemed like a waste of money. Outside it was snowing and I stood at the window watching the fat snowflakes disappear against the ground. I pictured Kamikaze bombers planting themselves headfirst into the pavement.</p>

<p>      When I came home from work, Mary was on the couch reading some self-help book. I knew she needed help but those books didn’t do shit. She had dozens of them in a crate underneath our bed, each one promising the same stuff. Save money and lose weight. Save money and lose weight. Discover spiritual enlightenment. Get your life in order. Get your life in order, fatass. Positive living. How to have a happy marriage. This book had a picture of a smiling man on its cover. The man was sitting in a wicker chair on the beach and didn’t look at the camera. The title was in big colorful block letters. Mary didn’t look up, and I headed into the kitchen and fixed myself a drink. I stole liquor from her stash beneath the kitchen sink and poured amaretto into a glass, mixing in SoCo and orange juice. It tasted bitter but I still managed to down it. I rinsed the glass, put it back in the cupboard and then carefully replaced Mary’s liquor. The sink was still full. I couldn’t see my face in the water.</p>

<p>      “Mary,” I called out. No answer. I shouted. “Mary!”</p>

<p>      “What?”</p>

<p>      I walked into the livingroom. The TV was off. I took a seat.</p>

<p>      “Where’s Cortez?”</p>

<p>      “I don’t know.” She still hadn’t looked up.</p>

<p>      I said, “I’m going to try feeding him again. Hopefully he’ll eat something, it’s been almost three weeks. I hope he does. That would be great for us, you know. It would be good. I’m not sure of the problem and I’m worried.”</p>

<p>      She didn’t respond, so I got up and walked around the house looking for Cortez and eventually found him underneath the dining room table coiled like a hose. I picked him up, the heavy bastard, with all the care in the world. Eight or nine feet long, thick like my neck. I carried him upstairs to the office and put him in the aquarium. He’d gotten so big that we’d needed the biggest aquarium at the petstore, and even then he had to stay mostly coiled up or  he wouldn’t fit. I took the mouse from the cardboard box it came and dangled it by it’s fat tail to watch it squirm. Cortez sat still. I dropped the mouse and as soon as it hit the sawdust, it ran into the corner and tried to climb. I watched it give up and try another corner. Cortez sat with his eyes shut. The mouse tried the first corner again and then slowly ventured closer to Cortez. Nothing happened. Soon the mouse was asleep in the sawdust. I felt sick, and the sawdust smelled like an playground.</p>

<p>      I left the mouse and went back downstair. In the kitchen I poured a glass of milk, drank it and then rinsed the glass. I returned the glass to the cupboard, studying the sink and the dirty dishes. Little bits of cereal had joined the floating fries. I left them there and then returned to the livingroom. Mary was still reading the book. I sat in my chair and watched her read. She looked up.</p>

<p>      “What?”</p>

<p>      I didn’t stop staring. “Nothing.”</p>

<p>      “Why do you keep staring at me?”</p>

<p>      “I don’t know.”</p>

<p>      I turned and watched the blank television. I watched Mary’s reflection as she read.</p>

<p>      “Stop that,” she said. Mary stared at me over the top of the book.</p>

<p>      “What?”</p>

<p>      “You’re humming that song again.” She paused. “I’m trying to read.”</p>

<p>      “Sorry.” I didn’t even realize what I was humming. Cortez the Killer. I went upstairs and took a shower. The water came out cold and stayed that way. Mary had used up all the hot water. I got out and toweled myself off, walked into the bedroom and got dressed. I could hear the mouse breathing, sitting, asleep. I walked into the lounge. In the aquarium  Cortez lay coiled up and silent. The mouse was still alive and I pulled its tail, dropping it back into the cardboard box.</p>

<p>      That night when Mary and I were lying in bed, Cortez floated into the room. I let him sleep with us at the bottom of the bed like a dog or cat. It didn’t bother me.</p>

<p>      “Wake up.”</p>

<p>      “Wake up.”</p>

<p>      I opened my eyes. Mary was frightened.</p>

<p>      “Jesus Christ. What is it?” I rubbed my face. It was dark in the room, and the curtains seemed to glow from the streetlight outside.</p>

<p>      “Look at Cortez. Jesus.”</p>

<p>      He was stretched between us on the bed. His head touched the pillow and his tail hung almost to the floor.</p>

<p>      “What’s wrong with him?” she asked.</p>

<p>      “I don’t know. We need to see a vet.”</p>

<p>      “I’m worried about him.”</p>

<p>      “Me too,” I answered.</p>

<p>      Cortez hadn’t moved but he was alive. He’d never slept like this before. I felt uncomfortable.</p>

<p>      “I hope he’s alright,” she said.</p>

<p>      “Me too.”</p>

<p>    I pulled Cortez from the bed and put him on the floor.</p>

<p>      When we woke up in the morning, Cortez was between us again.   
<br>    
<br>      Later that week I took him to the vet. The tired catladies in the waiting room eyed the huge cage. A dog cage with wheels because I couldn’t lift him and a cage at the same time. I went to the receptionist. The receptionist was bulbous and boring, her hair pulled into a ponitail at the nape of her neck. Only one side of her face seemed to smile, and she seemed insane from too much blinking.</p>

<p>      “Hello,” I said. “I need to see the vet.”</p>

<p>      “I’m sorry. It’s by appointment only.”</p>

<p>      “But this is serious. My python hasn’t eaten in almost a month.”</p>

<p>      The receptionist looked me over and then stared down into the cage.</p>

<p>      “That’s what’s in there?”</p>

<p>      “Yeah. My fourteen year old python.”</p>

<p>      “Your python’s in that cage?”</p>

<p>      “Yes.” I cleared my throat. “I really need to see the doctor.”</p>

<p>      “I’ll see what I can do.” She opened her appointment book and studied the day with her fat index finger and slender wrist. “I guess can fit you in after lunch.”</p>

<p>      “Alright. I’ll wait here. Thanks.”</p>

<p>      After she took my information I sat in the waiting room and read an old Time magazine. The main article dealt with the ever rising divorce rate. The writer wasn’t optimistic. I put down Time and picked up Reader’s Digest. More nothing. An old fat woman with hanging biceps stared at the cage. Her face looked like a busted pumpkin. The dog in her lap was some small, furry thing. Easy listening pumped from hidden speakers, the generic piano riff floating tightly above the reverberated sounds of a waterfall. It sounded like Chopin drowning.</p>

<p>      At one the receptionist led me into a small office with yellow walls. She took my information, asked the problem. She left and soon the vet came in. She was middle-aged with short brown hair. Her amorphous features remained perfectly hidden beneath a white coat.</p>

<p>      I smiled and began before she even sat down. “My fourteen year old python is sick. He’s stopped eating completely.  And I haven’t changed a thing if that’s what you’re thinking. I feed him the same food I always have. I feed him the same way I always have. So it’s not that. He just stopped eating.”</p>

<p>      “I’m sorry but I can’t help you.”</p>

<p>      “What?”</p>

<p>      “I’m not properly equipped to deal with reptiles. You’ll have to see a specialist.”</p>

<p>      I stared at her thin smile. It looked like she’d just come in from a cold wind.  I said, “There’s really nothing you can do?”</p>

<p>      “Not legally.”</p>

<p>      “I told your receptionist the problem. They made the appointment out there. They pencilled me in for this afternoon. It makes no sense.”</p>

<p>      “It makes perfect sense.” She turned her chair toward me and leaned forward, like we were friends. She kneaded one hand with the other, rotating hands. “You see, I haven’t studied reptiles and as such cannot properly diagnose any. . . reptilian ailment, serious or otherwise.”</p>

<p>      “I know, but your secretary—“</p>

<p>      “Receptionist,” she broke in.</p>

<p>      “Yes. She made the appointment. She knew I had a python and made an appointment anyway. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>      “Sir, I’m like any doctor, really. You wouldn’t have your family doctor perform brain surgery, would you? Of course not. He isn’t be qualified in the same way that I’m not qualified to treat your python.” She smiled again. “I’m sorry. I hope you understand.”</p>

<p>      The vet took my information and arranged an appointment with a specialist. She was on the phone for a few minutes. I left the room and hurried through the waiting room toward the door.</p>

<p>      “Sir!”</p>

<p>      I turned and saw the fat receptionist leaning toward me. She was hunched over her desk like some primitive charcoal sketch.</p>

<p>      “Sir, I need to talk to you.”</p>

<p>      She wants to apologize. She worked through lunch, was hungry, and just fucked up. Her mistake. No big deal. She probably forgot the doctor didn’t treat reptiles. I walked up to the desk.</p>

<p>      “Yes.”</p>

<p>      “Sir, you forgot your bill.”  
<br> 
<br>      I got into bed next to Mary. She kept her face in that book. I knew the book was a waste of time but she didn’t.  She seemed to think something could be learned from it.</p>

<p>      “So I guess the closest vet is in Fredericton.”</p>

<p>      She put her book down but kept the page. The book sat on her lap like a teepee.</p>

<p>      “That’s a four hour drive.” She sat there for a moment. She took her mug from the nightstand and drank. Then she said, “Is it four hours?”</p>

<p>      “Yes. It’s a four hour drive.”</p>

<p>      “We don’t have the money,” she said. “There’s no way we can afford a trip this close to Christmas. There’s no way—think of the bills. And the price of gas is through the roof. There’s no way.” She put down the mug and picked it right back up. The teepee book shifted but never collapsed.</p>

<p>      “Fuck Christmas,” I said.</p>

<p>      She put the mug down once again and shoved her bookmark into the book. She used an old Zellers flyer with the coupons cut out. The flyer was at least six months old. She examined the room from closet to closet. “There’s just no way we can take a four hour trip and on top of that pay that goddamn special vet and his special price. And then we’ll probably need some expensive medication. Jesus, and we’d need a hotel. We can’t afford it. There’s no way.”</p>

<p>      “Listen, Mary.” I didn’t tell her about the first vet bill. Even I wanted to whip the alarm clock through the closet door and I didn’t give a shit about bills. She’d have a fit. “We need to do this. And besides, you always say we should go out together. Do things. This is a good chance. This is something we should do, you know, together.”</p>

<p>      “Not what I had in mind.”</p>

<p>      I squirmed closer, slid up against her body. She felt warm even through her felt pajamas.</p>

<p>      “I think a trip would be fun,” I said. “When was the last time we went out of town?”</p>

<p>      Mary didn’t answer. And I honestly couldn’t remember. One summer we just didn’t go anywhere. And then the next. I barely remembered anything from the last few years other than sports champions and a few good movies. One day we just stopped everything. We’d spent the first year of our relationship outside along the river-front. We’d spent the last few years in front of a screen.</p>

<p>      Over the next couple days I pestered her until she finally caved. I told her we’d visit her family in the summer, said we’d drive up there and spend a week, and I’d be nice to them for a change. Or maybe I told her I’d quit drinking or we’d visit her parents in Alberta. I can’t remember and it doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>      We loaded up the car and set out early that Friday morning. I got an advance for the trip—not a lot of money but enough for food, a room, the vet bill and hopefully the medication. That fat bastard Tom had a fit in front of the staff when I asked for Friday off. Mary had me load her bags into the trunk the night before, and then she spent the whole evening worrying about them being stolen. She went to bed early, at seven or eight, and I sat in the lounge, drinking and smoking hash. When we pulled out the sky was grey and distant. The clouds seemed sharp like a crummy painting. The crunch beneath our boots and the frost on the car windshield made the air feel colder than it was. I let Mary put on the first CD. It was a female pop singer. She sang forgettable pop-country songs. After a while I couldn’t tell if the CD had looped –it probably had. Mary slept in the passenger seat with a pillow against the window. I ejected her disc and put it on the dash. We’d only been driving for over an hour and everything already looked the same. Naked trees and wire moose-fence. We passed through a small, vacant town. The rotted houses leaned inward or toward the road. Cars sat unshoveled in driveways. Their only industry jutted from the horizon of their little dying town and shat white and grey clouds into the sky. I drove, listening to my music and soon started picturing the families inside all the houses. Someone must have been screwing. Or maybe dinner before the television, mom and dad on the couch, the children positioned along the coffee table. </p>

<p> In a while I stopped for coffee near the outskirts of another town. Mary woke up and used the bathroom inside while I waited in the car. When she got back I pulled through the drive-thru and she ordered tea. She fell back asleep. The tea cooled in the cup holder and I eventually tossed it out the window. We arrived in Fredericton at one thirty, and by this point I was sweating. We were worried that Cortez would die if we didn’t keep the heat cranked. I drove through somewhat familiar streets until I found the mall. </p>

<p> I said, “How about a movie or something later.” </p>

<p> “A movie? What’s playing?” </p>

<p> “Dinner then.” I felt cathartic and for some reason needed everything to be alright. Mary smiled.  </p>

<p> “Alright,” she said. “That sounds nice.”</p>

<p>      “Yes, it does. I’ll give you a call after I see the vet.” 
<br> Mary opened the door and looked at the mall. She turned back.  
<br> “I’m glad I came,” she said. “We could use some time together away from home.” </p>

<p>I gave her a quick kiss and left. After a while I found the vet’s office in an old brick building downtown. The waiting room was small, and a coffee table covered in magazines sat an arm’s length from several chairs. Strange plants dangled from the corners of the room, the leaves like green plastic bowie knives. The receptionist greeted me with a smile and some forms. In the waiting room I took a seat and read about all the different colors of roses in an old copy of Home Gardener’s Monthly. I worried that I’d sometime given Mary the wrong colored rose, a rose of ‘motherly love.’ Only a few people sat around the room, and nobody looked up from their books or magazines. I think one lady with blue hair was doing a crossword puzzle. After a while I grew bored and anxious. It dawned on me that Cortez might actually die. Maybe I’d never drop him another mouse. Fourteen years seemed a long time, longer than I knew Mary. I had another wife then. I was afraid that I didn’t know the average lifespan of a python. Maybe fourteen was old. I grabbed a copy of some high-brow magazine. There was an article about the war on the drugs. It said the government was losing. I pictured hollow-faced meth addicts running through the streets of D.C. with gas-powered machine guns, cutting their way through the national guard and secret service, spreading up the lawn toward the White House. </p>

<p>      After a long while a black woman led me into the vet’s office. There were all sorts of cruel instruments lying about—stuff from a horror movie—stuff like pincers and clamps and prods and sticks. I think a box of hypodermic needles sat near the sink, but maybe it was a box of latex gloves. The veterinarian eventually came into the room and took a seat in a leather chair. He was an elderly man, and bald with a crooked nose. He looked like an animal himself, an eagle or crow. He’d squint until his eyes closed and then open them wide. Over and over he’d do this. I wanted to throw a punch.</p>

<p>      “So what seems to be the problem,” he asked. He studied the cage and Cortez inside.</p>

<p>      “He stopped eating,” I said.</p>

<p>      “When?” the vet asked. I didn’t know for sure.</p>

<p>      “About a month ago now.”</p>

<p>      “I see, I see.” The vet examined the cage some more as if it held some hint I was too stupid to see. “Have you noticed anything else unusual?”</p>

<p>      “No,” I said. And then I remember. “Well, his sleeping patterns have changed.”</p>

<p>      The vet’s head snapped up. “Yes?”</p>

<p>      “Yeah. He used to sleep coiled up at the bottom of the bed.”</p>

<p>      “Wait,” the vet said. “You let it loose around the house?”</p>

<p>      I shrugged. “Yeah. He’s pretty big and the aquarium seems cramped so I let him out.”</p>

<p>      The vet paused. He turned in his chair and grabbed a small notebook from the desk. He turned back and wrote something. He seemed worried. “How, exactly, have its sleeping patterns changed?”</p>

<p>      “He sleeps alongside us now,” I explained. “Like he’s sleeping with us. I’m worried. He seems to be expecting death, like he wants to be close while dying. We’ve had him a long time you know. He’s more than family.”</p>

<p>      I felt sick. The vet wrote something new.</p>

<p>      “How old is it?”</p>

<p>      “Fourteen.”</p>

<p>      The vet turned his back to me and placed the notebook back onto the desk. He spoke to me this way.</p>

<p>      “I’m really sorry but I can’t let you leave with the snake.”</p>

<p>      “Pardon?”</p>

<p>      The vet spun to face me. He squinted his eyes away and soon snapped them wide. “Your python is staying here.”</p>

<p>      “What?” I wanted to mash his glasses into his face. This didn’t make sense. I was afraid. The doctor squinted.</p>

<p>      “Your python is fasting. That’s why it won’t eat. When it sleeps alongside you, it’s sizing you up to see how big you are,” the vet said. “He wants to eat you.” </p>

<p> I carried Cortez’s empty cage into the hotel lobby with a couple bags of luggage. I should have left the damn cage in the car, but I wheeled it with me anyway. When I opened my wallet and showed her the reservation for a third time, she gave me the keycards. The room was beige, and outside the window sat a neat little courtyard with benches and trees. A policeman stood guard at the doorway. From the fourth floor window I could see the windows of other rooms and pigeons along the rooftop. The windows didn’t open. I put the cage on the bed and went into the bathroom. When the light came on I heard a fan whip overhead and removed the grate from above the big mirror, baptized and lit a joint. I blew the smoke into the fan. When I’d finished, I replaced the grate. The cage lay empty on the floor, and I studied the courtyard again. The policeman hadn’t moved. He was still alone. What the fuck is he guarding? And then I noticed. The outside windows were painted onto the wall, and so were the pigeons. I stared hard and saw that the officer had cartoon features. The benches were real, but everything else was some homely tableau. Even the door was fake. I didn’t feel hungry anymore. </p>
