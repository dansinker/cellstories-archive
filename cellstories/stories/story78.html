<h2>Birthday Suit</h2>

	<p>
		</p><p>I recently visited San Francisco with my friend Liz.  The day we arrived I was psyched to read that my favorite band, the New Pornographers, were playing that weekend, but as luck would have it, the show was completely sold out.   So I did what any savvy city girl would: I hopped on Craig’s list.  Within twenty-four hours I had arranged to meet Rob, who would sell me his General Admission tickets at an only slightly inflated rate.  About twenty minutes before we were supposed to meet up in front of the GAP on Market, he called to let me know he was running late.  No biggee.  I waited patiently until he arrived.  He was about twenty: muscle tee, faux hawk, definitely gay, and after a few minutes of obligatory chit chat we made our transaction and parted ways. </p>

<p>Fast forward twelve hours.  Liz and I had seen the concert and had been out all night drinking.  In the wee hours of the morning we found ourselves in the Mission smoking pot at our new friend Nate’s apartment.  He was about thirty: tattooed, bearded, definitely NOT gay.  Well, one thing led to another and Nate and I ended up making out.  It was fun, it was sexy, he wanted me to stay, but “no, I have to go, I can’t ditch my friend…” and all that business.  Nate dictated his number to me and I called his cell, (you know, the number exchange of the 21st century?), then Liz and I caught a cab and we were off.  I decided to send him a cute, flirty text, you know, wrap up the encounter in a nice little bow. “You’re very sexy” I typed, “It was lovely meeting you.”  I scrolled through my phone and found my last missed call – the one with the unfamiliar area code - and pressed send.  And then realized Nate never called me - I called his phone - then who…? I had sent the message to Rob.  The gay muscle tee, faux hawk Craig’s list guy.  At four in the morning!  “Please don’t respond, please don’t respond,” I pleaded with my phone.  But sure enough, at ten the next morning I woke up to a text reading: “I’m truly flattered.  But I have a girlfriend.”  What?!  This dude was totally gay, but more importantly, I was mortified, and yet, what could I really do?  I couldn’t explain the mix up via text, I had to just go with it.  “Heartbreaker” I texted back. </p>

<p>The thing is: shit like this happens to me ALL THE TIME.  Like when I was on this date with a hot sax player and ate a table spoon of wasabi, thinking it was guacamole, then ended up hyperventilating for ten minutes.  Or the time I was at Sushi Samba on a date with this older guy and one of the busers, who was coming down the stairs above us, lost his balance and dropped a piece of regurgitated chicken on my head.  That was awesome!  I often imagine that my life is some poorly written sitcom that can’t afford a laugh track.  So I have to do my best to laugh at myself.  Which I can usually do… except for this one time: </p>

<p>My 26th birthday fell on a Monday when I had to work overtime.  It certainly wasn’t an ideal start to my twenty-seventh orbit around the sun, but my co-workers surprised me with a birthday celebration that morning which made me feel at least a little bit better.  </p>

<p>“Happy Birthday to you, Happy birthday to you…” they started singing the moment I walked in. “Happy Birthday dear Margot…” Does anyone else feel embarrassed about being sung to? I loved it as a kid “everyone’s singing to me!”, now it’s just kind of awkward.  Like, should I sing along?  But wait, then I’d be singing to myself, which seems sort-of indulgent. So I just kinda smiled and laughed and after scarfing down my birthday bagel, I sat down at my desk for a long day’s work. </p>

<p>Okay, so at this theater company I worked for, I was basically a glorified receptionist, and the offices were laid out like this:  the front door opened into the reception area where I sat (facing the wall), the conference room was directly on the left.  If you walked past the reception area and turned right that’s where the first floor cubicle farm was.  The offices were divided between two floors, and one of my responsibilities was answering the front door.  We didn’t have a buzzer, that would’ve been much too easy. No, we had me getting up from my desk every three minutes to let someone in.  When I was getting up every three minutes, it was usually to let someone in from upstairs who had forgotten their keys.  This was one of the more infuriating tasks I was subjected to.  And so, I came up with a little routine to punish these absentminded upstairs folk. </p>

<p>A typical interaction went like this: Picture me sitting at my desk facing my computer screen.  Peripherally I can see a woman walk up to the front door.  She stands there waiting for me to open it.  I continue to work pretending not to see her.  Finally, annoyed by waiting, she knocks.  I turn toward the door, a surprised look on my face reading “oh I didn’t even see you there.”  Then I open the door.  She pushes past me, irritated.   </p>

<p>I always wait for the knock. People cannot expect me to read their minds. I require concrete manifestation of their need for my assistance. </p>

<p>So, I was sitting at my desk sensing a body approach the front door, therefore, I immediately starred deeper into my computer screen.  Well, when about thirty seconds went by and no knock, I begrudgingly turned my head towards the door and saw not a co-worker, but a pink gorilla holding twelve balloons and energetically waving at me.   </p>

<p>Huh.  </p>

<p>Now the Theater Company did a lot of birthday parties and kids’ classes so I assumed that this fuzzy, florescent person was just on the wrong floor.  I opened the door and addressed the pink gorilla in the same pinched tone I used when dealing with the overly chatty FedEx guy.  “Hi, what can I do for you?” </p>

<p>“Are you Margot?” the pink gorilla asked. I narrowed my eyes. I don’t trust Southern accents as a rule, besides this gorilla looked grimy. The synthetic fur of her suit was matted, clearly dry cleaning had been bypassed for the spin cycle. Now, it’s unclear to me whether or not nylon can contract mange, but something was eating away at patches of the fur just above her knees. The only things seemingly free of wear-and-tear were her bright, white tennis shoes.  </p>

<p>“What’s this all about?” I asked, evading her question. </p>

<p>“I’ve been told it’s your Birthday!” and with that she barged past me, set down her ratty duffle bag and boom box, pressed play and started a sort-of spoken word birthday poem routine thing.  “My name is Pinky and I’m hear to say, Happy, happy birthday, it’s your special day!”   </p>

<p>Before I had an opportunity to respond, she pulled out a magenta stuffed gorilla and began using it as a puppet.  “Hello, how are you?  Happy Birthday!”  She set the stuffed animal on my desk, placed a flimsy aluminum crown on my head and a green leafed leigh around my neck.   </p>

<p>“W--uh, uh…” I was in a state of utter shock and my brain couldn’t keep up with Pinky’s actions. Gorilla--birthday--singing.  What was going on? Who had sent this to me?  Could it be from a group of friends? It definitely wasn’t from my family, maybe my boyfriend? It was right about then I noticed my co-workers getting up from their desks and peeking into the reception area.  The Manager of Individual Giving walked in, took one look at Pinky, then me in my birthday crown, and turned on her heels and scampered back.  Out of the corner of my eye I could see the Grants Manager sink down into the depths of her wheely chair.  I was being abandoned! </p>

<p>My attention snapped back to Pinky whose singing was becoming shriller.  “They say it’s your birthday! Do, do, do, do, do, do” As she gyrated the jaw of her rubber gorilla mask wobbled, held together by two pieces of scotch tape and nothing more.  Through the sagging mouth hole I could see the woman’s double chin and the sweat running down it.  She was somewhere in her early to mid fifties, old enough to be my mother.    </p>

<p>Suddenly I flashed back a decade to my 16th birthday.  The day my mom was laid off from her nursing position, and having three kids to support, took a job mopping floors at the Burger Stop.  Naturally I felt the job was beneath her and was ashamed on her behalf.  Because when you’re sixteen, your social status is defined by your parent’s profession and income.  After she came home exhausted and weary after her first day, I didn’t hesitate from verbalizing my distain: “can’t you find something else? Why would you do this?” She worked that job for eight months before finding something better, and I witnessed the way it wore her down both in body and spirit.  </p>

<p>Ever since then I’ve always felt uncomfortable around older people in service positions.  I see an old man working the counter at Jack in the Box, and instead of deciding which burger to order, I begin concocting a tragic tale of humiliation and no alternatives. Because no one would ever choose a job like that right?  They must be forced to do it. So what was this woman’s story?  She wasn’t some young sprightly actor so clearly, HOPEFULLY, she wasn’t following a dream. </p>

<p>Up to this point in my life I had assumed all singing telegrams were similar to the one Bette Midler performs in Beaches.  Do you remember? She wears a charming bunny suit and sings to John whatshisname who goes on to become instrumental in launching her singing career.  This scene had led me to believe (naively, I now realize), that one must possess skill to deliver singing telegrams.  Or at least be blessed with the ability to sing on key. I was certain Pinky’s voice was being heard by canines across Chicago.  And why was I the human Audience Of One for this display?  Where were my co-workers?  </p>

<p>Panic is an epidemic and it had quickly infected the entire office. I glanced into Pinky’s dime-sized eye holes and immediately recognized her look: heightened anxiety. She was aware of the effect she was having, but she had a job to do!  Without warning she pressed herself against the conference room door where the Marketing department was meeting, “come on out and join us!” she shrieked through the glass.  Smelling desperation, they shook their heads and pulled down the blinds.  Pinky turned back to me; we stood frozen in a face-off before she lunged for her bag, snatching up a hand clapper toy and vigorously waving it in my face.  “A round of applause for your birthday!” Mid-wave the clapper broke, a plastic hand falling to the floor.  “Whoopsee, that – that’s not supposed to happen.” </p>

<p>I don’t experience panic attacks but by this point I was freaking the fuck out.  The notion that I should respond to her performance with grace was overwhelmed by the weight of humiliation I felt for the both of us. My body was shaking, my face was flushed, I was breathing audibly.  </p>

<p>“Stop! I said.  “That’s enough, thank you!”   </p>

<p>“But I still have one more song!” A new track started on the CD player and she began box stepping and clapping in rhythm.  Good god, not a dance routine.</p>

<p>“No seriously, stop.  You have to go” I said turning off the boom box.  “I have work to do, thank you.”  And with that I placed hands against matted fur and began pushing her out the door.  Her muscles strained beneath the suit.  </p>

<p>“But I’m not done!  Please, just let me do one more song!”  </p>

<p>“No, no, no you’ve done enough, goodbye,” I said and threw all my weight against the door before hearing the relieving click of the lock.   </p>

<p>This may have been my first singing telegram, but I knew instinctually that this was not how they were meant to go down. Everyone was supposed to gather around and laugh at my embarrassment allowing me to laugh too.   </p>

<p>I marched around the corner and suddenly everyone was on a phone call.  Everyone except the Grants Manager. “My God!” I said. “Why didn’t you come out there?”  </p>

<p>Still cowering in her chair she answered, “I’m sorry, I was having flashbacks about when I used to deliver singing telegrams in New York. I used to have to dress up like Ariel and go to birthday parties--” </p>

<p>“Okay, okay,” I said, “I get it.”   </p>

<p>I turned to the other two women in Development; the Director covered the mouthpiece of her receiver and whispered “it was just too much”.</p>

<p>I stood there for a moment looking from one face to the next.  I had no idea who Pinky’s normal clientele was, but clearly it wasn’t us. At one point or another all four of us had suffered the degradations of the service industry before escaping into the white collar world of arts administration.  Maybe Pinky’s predicament just hit too close to home. I mean, let’s be honest, I’m still only a layoff away from returning to a life of working registers, mopping floors, or… delivering singing telegrams.  It’s easy to turn humiliation into amusement if you’re the only one who’s suffered, but I had just pushed this middle aged woman out the front door. </p>

<p>My hands were still shaking as I walked back to my desk and looked out my window.  There she was, still in her suit, climbing into a beat up pickup truck.  She sat in the driver’s seat for a moment before taking off the gorilla head and setting it on the seat beside her.  She rubbed her hand across her face and took a breath. There was still time to throw open the locked door and run out to her.  “I’m sorry” I would say.  “I don’t know you, or your story, but I know that what you’re doing is hard.  Forgive me.” But before I had a chance, she started her car and pulled out into the street.</p>
