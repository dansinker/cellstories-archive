<h2>Girl #3</h2>
	<h3>Nichole McGill</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>The reason I may die today is because I saw Girl #2 last fall.</p>

<p>      I’m not superstitious or anything. And don’t think I scare easily, either. I’ve dealt with plenty of creeps before. You know--guys that stare at you until their brains fall out of their mouths. I may only be fourteen, five foot nothing, with stubby legs, but when I run in a track meet or circle the grid of suburban houses that mark my “hood,” I surprise everyone.</p>

<p>      Still, I know in my skin that all the wrong things that have happened in the five months from then until now, they all started with that stupid gorgeous Indian summer afternoon in October, when I took Ripley for a bike ride through my ravine.</p>

<p>      What else was I supposed to do? It was after school. I didn’t have track for the first time in forever. Alicia (best friend and fellow track fiend and Jaguar team mate) had skipped out on geography to grab a bus to Sherway Gardens to “catch the sidewalk sales” with Melissa (a supposed hurdler whose smile is as tight as her pants). Mum was at work…naturally. And there she was: Ripley. Waiting patiently for me at home, chained to a rusty pipe in the garage. The first fallen leaves had inched their way in and nestled in her spokes. Ripley’s my tough girl mountain bike and she’s like this garish neon orange colour, her frame plastered with crazy purple stickers, half of which have ripped off, leaving sticky grey ghosts. I so love her, and not just because her clashing colours continue to offend my every-hair-glued-in-the-right-place mother. I found Ripley beaten up and abandoned behind the local strip mall. When I dragged her skeleton home, Mum immediately turned her nose up at her dreadful state of hygiene. I was forced to resort to a paper route and Dad money to get her fixed up. Ripley and I are blood, even if she is mostly metal and rubber. </p>

<p>      So I returned her shiny grin and took her up on her challenge. I unlocked her and pointed her knobbed tires down my quiet street, cruised past all the two storey houses dappled with sun, and emerged into the smoky chaos and traffic on the bottleneck that is Eglinton Avenue. Luckily, there’s a sliver of bike path for little old me.</p>

<p>       I choked back exhaust as I whipped by seven lanes of cars frozen in rush hour (suckers!), gaining crazy momentum as the path ran downhill, then suddenly dipped to the left and—relief!—Ripley and I shot under a canopy of trees that were just turning into flames. I was in and flying through a protective tunnel of green, red, and orange. I sped past fat bushes and hairy maples, picking up colossal speed. The wind was pushing my short black hair so it stood on end and probably looked whacked (yeah, yeah—no helmet. I know, Mum, Officer Murdoch-who-came-to-speak-at-our-high-school), but I didn’t care. This was my place. It was my ravine. Here, I didn’t have to worry about Alicia hanging with Melissa, or accusing me of liking the guys she likes, or that she’s already moving up the popular ranks at Parkside C. I. despite being a niner while I kind of stay on the periphery, or that I hadn’t heard from Dad since last Christmas and why couldn’t Parkside have a mountain biking team? All of these thoughts flew away with the wind. I whipped past my favourite part, the bushy forest that climbs the hill to the quiet street above. The trees are a wall between the forest and plains except where they cut in an upside down “U” to reveal a dirt path that winds up the hill.</p>

<p>      And that’s where and when I saw her: Girl #2.</p>

<p>      I know what you’re going to say, “Wait, there’s no way this could have happened in October! You mean, August, maybe beginning of September, right?”</p>

<p>      Nope. I saw her on October the fifteenth, a Wednesday. And I fully realize the implications. Like I said, I don’t scare easily. Not that there was anything immediately eerie about her appearance in my ravine—apart from, you know, the obvious.</p>

<p>      When I zipped past her, my eyes took a snapshot in full detail that still causes my eyeballs to ache in memory. Girl #2 was perched in a maple tree set just a little back from the path entrance and so spindly there was no way it could have actually held her weight, even if she did weigh nothing. Her thin legs dangled and swayed with the wind, her auburn hair straight and serious, cut with Cleopatra bangs. Her eyes, leaf green, caught in the sun, piercing in a flash, the leaves around her turning into flames.</p>

<p>      Of course, I knew in my gut who she was immediately. Everybody knows what Girl #2 looks like—everyone in Toronto, anyway.</p>

<p>      But it gets weirder. I not only saw her, I felt her: just as surely as if she had laid a thin, white hand on my head. I felt a tingling on my scalp and a current cut through my skin that launched me past the forest and around the bend to the dead grass plateau where the kids’ swings are, their metal chains tangled and rusting together. It was only there that I dared set my sneakers on the ground and look back to double-check, my heart searing my skin.</p>

<p>      Alright, maybe she did freak me out a bit.</p>

<p>      I can’t say how long I stood there waiting for my skin to settle. It’s not like I had to be home for dinner: Mum wouldn’t be home until after 9:30 p.m. Until then, I had plenty of dead time to fall into and so that’s exactly what I did. I stood there on the bike path watching as a couple of other bikers (obviously just recreational) cruised past, completely oblivious to the fact that the most famous, the most known girl in Toronto at that moment was examining them from the safety of her shelter barely ten metres away; that is, if she was still there. I couldn’t see her from this angle. </p>

<p>      You have to go back.</p>

<p>      This was what my super bossy voice said. She’s like this demanding, brassy voice inside my head—kind of like a know-it-all older sister who always gets grounded for setting the neighbour’s petunia bed on fire or baiting a model-wannabe to a slugfest. Maybe you have a crazy voice in your head, too, one that says all of the things you’re thinking but are too scared to admit you’re thinking, much less say out loud.</p>

<p>      So I said back to her, silently: No freaking way!</p>

<p>      It’s okay. I mean, what could she possibly do to you in her state?</p>

<p>      She couldn’t do anything to me. Girl#2 was just a girl—like me. Actually, when I thought about it—frozen on the pathway, staring at the black smudge on my sneakers, a sudden warm gust tickling the blond hairs on my neck, then the black spikes of my shorn hair—I calmed down. Girl#2 was a lot like me, right? But not in the obvious ways.</p>

<p>      She had long hair, for one, fine like red thread. She was tall—taller than me anyway, but that’s not exactly difficult. And she lived downtown, amidst a million tiny shops and corner stores bursting with flowers and fruit and life. Not like me, in west end snor-burbia. I had to bike two clicks to the nearest strip mall for an average chocolate bar.</p>

<p>      Still, neither of us had siblings, and our birthdays were a month apart. She also liked completely obnoxious mixtures of colours like lime green with chocolate and orange. And the place that she’d escape to when she was most upset—and the papers went on and on about this as if she’d asked for it or something—was her ravine.</p>

<p>      I should probably explain the ravines. Toronto’s basically a slab of concrete except for four green ravines that break it up, and each of these ravines has a thin, drizzling river in it. There’s mine—quiet Mimico in the far west—then there’s the Humber, which has a fancy old mill in it. In the east (Scarborough) there’s the Rouge, which is also boring, but at least it can boast having deer. At least, that’s the rumour. And right in the middle there’s the Don; it has a river that belches fish farts into the air and a highway running through it, as well as enough dense forest surrounding it that a girl could find her own private hideaway. And Girl #2 had done just that. Hers was a simple platform in a beautiful birch tree.  </p>

<p>      Still, there was one major thing that set us apart. Girl #2 is dead.</p>

<p>      I craned my neck to look back. The path was empty. With shuffling legs, I turned Ripley around. I had to see if this girl—who had been buried four days earlier, on Sunday, October 11, in a private ceremony that spilled out into the streets, who was on the front page of the papers since she went missing in early September—if she really was just hanging out, sitting on a tree branch, in my ravine.</p>

<p>      I biked back. I churned each leg slowly, feeling my heart beating about a hundred miles a minute with each turn of my leg, until I reached the tree canopy where she had been swaying and looked up.</p>

<p>      Only the leaves blinked back.</p>

<p>      It took me a while to register this. No way! She had been there. I had felt her.</p>

<p>      I dismounted Ripley and walked up the grassy hill trying to catch a glimpse. Ripley’s knobbly tires chewed up the grass as I trudged, but I still couldn’t see her. </p>

<p>      My heart was no longer beating superstitious panic—now I was frustrated. I ran up the rest of the hill, digging in my sneakers, grass and dirt kicking backwards as I went up the rough path, thick bushes to either side of me. I reached the top only to see a thin alley of green between two high backyard fences.</p>

<p>      No one.</p>

<p>      But I did see her on the fifteenth of October, exactly five months ago, in my ravine—piddly Mimico, it’s not even a real river, barely a drizzle of a creek—two valleys west of the wild downtown ravine where a week earlier, a man walking his dog found her wrapped on that platform she’d made in the white arms of her birch tree.</p>

<p>      Nothing can convince me otherwise.</p>

<p>      So it’s no surprise I guess, that it’s her I’m thinking of right this very moment. It’s March now. Winter came but it hasn’t quite checked out, as the piles of snotty snow around my sneakers prove.</p>

<p>      Can you feel that?</p>

<p>      A wind like an iced hand is inching up my spine. I’m in my ravine, wimpy Mimico, crouching in a bed of dead, mulched leaves. My skin puckers into goose bumps, my trembling thigh muscles on the verge of seizing from crouching too long in the same position. Only the adrenaline, the sweet adrenaline coursing from behind my bulged eyes to my chilled feet reminds me that I’m alive, so terrifyingly alive even as I strain not to move.</p>

<p>      My brain is screaming. Can you hear it?</p>

<p>      If you move, he might see you! And if he sees you, he’ll collect you…and if he collects you, you may never see anything ever again.</p>

<p>      The wind knocks on my nose but I’m not going to answer. I command my muscles to stay put. </p>

<p>      I won’t let him catch me. I won’t become Girl #3. </p>
