<h2>Nice to Meet Jew</h2>
	<h3>Aaron Hamburger</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>It was David’s first night in Berlin, and he felt abandoned and annoyed.  He was visiting the city as part of a delegation of Jewish Day School teachers from America, each of whom had been paired up with a Jewish Berliner as a tour guide for the evening.  But while the rest of David’s colleagues had long gone off to their family dinners, David was still sitting alone, dressed in his best khakis, waiting in his hotel room for his “date.”</p>

<p>When Thomas finally arrived, at eleven, David had prepared one of his speeches, the kind he gave to his students when they failed to turn in their Jewish Values essays on time.  But as he opened the door to let Thomas in, David forgot what he was going to say.</p>

<p>The sight of Thomas was a shock.  He had dark blond hair, molded with a kind of gel that made it spike upward in front.  His thick lips were carved into a heart-shaped pucker, and his eyes were indigo blue and alert, as if he’d just been tapped on the shoulder.  He wore a black shirt tucked into tight black jeans that fit his legs so snugly David couldn’t imagine how Thomas would get out of them later.  Perhaps he’d have to peel them off like a layer of skin.</p>

<p>“Hey, nice to meet Jew!” Thomas said, after they exchanged introductions.  “Get it?  Nice.  To.  Meet.  Jew.”</p>

<p>“I get it,” said David, who got the feeling he wasn’t going to like German humor.  “Shall we go?”</p>

<p>Thomas and he rode a tram packed with teenagers headed for a night out. “So you’re a homosexual?” said Thomas.</p>

<p>Nervous, David giggled a bit, then said sternly, “They shouldn’t have told you that.  That’s got nothing to do with anything.”</p>

<p>“Too late,” Thomas said.  “I want you to know that although I am straight, I am not narrow.  Isn’t that how they say it in English?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said David, trying to hide his excitement by sounding irritated.  “That’s how they say it in English.”</p>

<p>They disembarked at Rosa Luxemburg Platz, in the former East Berlin. The neighborhood looked fashionable, with cafes, art supply stores, and boutiques selling tight-fitting t-shirts printed with symbols from the former DDR, lately in vogue.</p>

<p>“Is the restaurant nearby?” asked David.</p>

<p>“We’re not going to a restaurant,” said Thomas.  “I’m taking you somewhere better.”</p>

<p>Thomas led him to a building where a piece of graph paper marked by an arrow had been taped to the front door. The light in the lobby flickered on and off, but it was enough to find another door decorated in duct tape letters that said: PARTY HERE. </p>

<p>“Are you sure this is a safe neighborhood?” asked David.</p>

<p>“Don’t be so chicken,” Thomas said, pushing him into the courtyard.</p>

<p>The party was in a concrete bunker at the back of the yard, just your usual Berlin courtyard, with recycling bins and a fleet of bicycles locked to a metal rack. As they entered the bunker, the music from inside blared as if to push them out again.  “I should go back to the hotel,” he said, but Thomas pulled him down a narrow stairway to a dark green grotto with girls and boys lined up against the walls. There were no windows, no emergency exits. </p>

<p>What am I doing here? David thought.  If he left me, how would I find my way back?  “Everyone’s so young,” said David, feeling as if he’d blundered into one of his students’ parties. </p>

<p>“Not at all,” said Thomas.  “Many of them are our age.”</p>

<p>Our age? David thought, flattered to be included. David shouted over the music.  “This music’s giving me a headache. I don’t feel very well.”  </p>

<p>“This will help.”  Thomas dug in his pocket and produced a small gold box.  Inside were some white pills. “Take one for your headache,” he shouted.</p>

<p>“Just one?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the medicine is stronger in Europe than what you’re used to in the States.”</p>

<p>“This isn’t medicine, is it?”</p>

<p>Thomas shrugged, and smiled. “Come on. Let’s have fun.”</p>

<p>David had never done anything stronger than marijuana. But Thomas was holding out his soft white hand and staring at him with a dreamy, contented look on his face, so David took his magic pill. Fun, he thought. Okay, I can have fun.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it great here?”  Thomas said, mussing David’s hair. “Totally underground.  The DJ is from Spain.  The music is from France.”</p>

<p>“Impressive,” David said, still feeling Thomas’s fingers in his hair.</p>

<p>“I am happy you came here. Berliners are so fucking conservative. That’s why I love to meet Americans.  What do you do for fun in the place where you are from?”</p>

<p>“Detroit?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Detroit. What do you do for fun in Detroit?”</p>

<p>David hesitated. “I don’t know, exactly.” </p>

<p>The truth was that now that his forties were drawing near, he’d finally found balance in his life, the measured happiness of an adult who knew who he was. He had a checkbook, a profession, a mortgage. He’d learned how to cook for one and fold shirts so they didn’t wrinkle. He sat with friends in shul and paid shiva calls and lit candles on Friday nights and holidays. He’d given up going to bars and all the confusion that entailed.</p>

<p>Thomas looked at him strangely, and then David felt as if they were floating together. “How do you feel?” Thomas said. Their lips touched, delicately at first, then pressed more firmly, and David felt a strange force in his veins, moving his hands and his hips.</p>

<p>“Hey, you want some water?” Thomas asked, suddenly tearing himself away.</p>

<p>“Sure,” said David, still a bit dizzy.</p>

<p>“Wait here.” </p>

<p> “You’ll come back, won’t you?” said David, suddenly clinging to Thomas’s arm.</p>

<p>“You can trust me,” he said, then disappeared.</p>

<p>David felt a bit woozy, so he sat on one of the steps and watched the dance floor, mostly empty but for a few brave souls moving to the Beatles singing “I Wanna Hold Your Hand” in German (“Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand”). One buried his nose in his elbow and stuck out his arm like an elephant raising his trunk.  Another craned his long neck, which was painted in glitter. They wore pacifiers that lit up blue and red around their necks and drank water out of baby bottles.</p>

<p>Teenagers squeezed past him roughly, stepped over his head, shook hands across his lap. His cheeks and fingers and hips tingled with the heat of the room. Where am I? David wondered.  I’ve made a big mistake.</p>

<p>The lights went off, then came back on as a strobe.  Clouds of talcum powder burst up in great plumes.  The dance floor filled with warm, young bodies, women with magenta-striped hair and sweaty young men in ski caps. Gagging, David pushed himself up, and a girl pulled him onto the floor. He rocked back and forth in time to the relentless beat, but he’d forgotten how to move his arms and legs.</p>

<p>The music shot up another chord, sparking a cheer from the crowd, and the beat grew faster and louder so that it pounded through his stomach. A go-go dancer in a fluorescent bikini came down the spiral staircase, barefoot, then hopped on top of a black pedestal, and now everyone in the room was jumping up and down. </p>

<p>David stood on his toes to get a better look around, and then he stopped worrying. He felt like laughing, so hard and so deep, it actually felt more like an intense sobbing, like a prayer. He understood then how a body could move to express consciousness, and, and, so many things he’d confused for so long, they were all becoming clear now. The pleasure felt divine. He was divine.  Divine, divine.  The word kept coming back, erasing all other thoughts. And now his tongue itched like sandpaper. He was so terribly desperate for a drink of water, he forgot his own name.</p>

<p>“Wasser!  Wasser!” he gasped in German. </p>

<p>A young woman with pigtails offered him water and a bear hug.</p>

<p>“This your first time here?” the woman asked, possibly in English.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he shouted.</p>

<p>“You’re from America, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he shouted again, forgetting to be embarrassed about George Bush and Iraq.</p>

<p>“I’ve been in America, like five times. It’s beautiful, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“Life is beautiful, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>He looked around the room. So many people were laughing. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d laughed like this. Smirked perhaps, or chuckled politely, but never giving in to deep, full-bodied laughter.  </p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” he cried out.  “Life really is beautiful!”</p>

<p>A stranger handed them a baby bottle, and they took turns sucking at the plastic nipple. The music faded except for the drums, tens upon tens of tiny drums and cymbals crashing, and then a blast of beat and sweet melody, and the dancer’s bikini melted away and only a black g-string was left and the crowd stuffed euro bills into the straps, but David didn’t care any more because he was dancing so hard and really feeling the rhythm and global groove of the music. It was like Simchat Torah, Purim, and the Fourth of July all in one, and the German woman in pigtails exclaimed, “I love you!” and he shouted back, “I love you too!” and she said, “What?” and he shouted again, “I love you too!” and they kissed, even exchanged tongues, until David remembered he was gay. Then they hugged and someone else hugged them too, and it seemed he could have all the love he’d ever wanted for the rest of his life. He caught a glimpse of Thomas across the room and he wanted to be near him while singing and dancing to such great and beautiful music. He tried to cut through the crowd, but it wasn’t easy with the lights in his face and the smell of sweat and talcum powder and the plastic flowers swinging overhead. A net of arms locked together pushed him away and he pushed back. Behind and in front of him, people were tugging at his shirt, and the buttons popped open and his chest hair was showing, and then his stomach. </p>

<p>“You’re beautiful,” a boy whispered in German. </p>

<p>Everyone seemed to be kissing each other at once.  The DJ had lost all of his clothes, except for a baseball cap and a pair of headphones he held up to his ear. David turned away and saw a man relaxing, shirtless, on a sofa with a woman bending over to tell him a secret, or no, to give him a blow job.</p>

<p>Suddenly David slipped on a puddle of water and fell backward through the crowd.  He kept whirling his arms and kicking his feet, trying to flail himself back up, but it was no use. There he was, going down like an old klutz.</p>

<p>But then… someone caught him. A boy. Or two boys, one wearing yellow sunglasses and the other with a shaved head. They asked him in German if he was okay, and he looked at their faces, so kind, so radiant with heat and youth and electric lights, so concerned for the greater good and happiness of all humanity, for world peace, that there was nothing else he could do but shout, “Wunderbar!”  And they all began dancing in a circle, arms linked, heads thrown back, until they were too dizzy to stand.</p>

<p><h4>* * *</h4></p><p>The rest of the night he remembered afterward in blips and patches.  There was a moment, which could have been a dream, when he flung his shirt over his head to the roar of the crowd, and another moment when he sat crouched in a corner feeling very sick and refusing to talk to anyone. My life has turned out all wrong, he realized.</p>

<p>It was already light outside when he ended up crying in a taxi with an Aryan-looking man he didn’t recognize, who turned out to be Thomas.  He rubbed David’s hand and said soothingly in English, “Drink this. It’s only water.  Nothing more.”</p>
