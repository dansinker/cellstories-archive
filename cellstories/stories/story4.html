<h2>Chili</h2>
	<h3>John H. Matthews</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>For one night and one night only, Kenneth Jackson’s famous chili enabled some people in Taggert County to speak to the dead.</p>

<p>	Who could say exactly what proportions of meat, onion, garlic, tomato sauce, chili powder, sweet pepper, basil, kidney beans, tabasco and El Dorado Elixir (a Jackson family secret) were responsible. At least four people who visited Kenneth’s Chili Wagon at the McKinley Summer Festival had supernatural visits from the grave later that night.</p>

<p>	Herb Nofsinger sat alone at his kitchen table at ten p.m. with a glass of cold whiskey in his hand listening to June bugs whap against the screen of the back door. It was pitch black out. So black that the streetlight beyond his back yard seemed almost swallowed whole.</p>

<p>	Herb felt strange and a little sad. That day he had gone to the festival and wandered around looking for familiar faces. He saw a few—Dewey, who cashiered over at the Marathon, and A-Bomb who helped him with the volunteer Gazebo construction project—but for the most part, McKinley seemed overrun with people he didn’t recognize. He’d chatted with Aaron Waggoner near the courthouse then he got some chili and left.
<br>	
<br>The tick of the stove clock counted away the seconds and in his heart, Herb felt a hard pull. His thoughts returned to Sarah,  his wife who died the year before. He wanted so badly to hear the sandpaper whisper of her slippers on the tile of the kitchen. He wanted to hear her sigh as she slid a bookmark into her novel just before going to bed. </p>

<p>	When the handle on the door turned and Sarah came into the kitchen, there was no fear in Herb Nofsinger. There was only a terrible and profound ache. He rose and looked into the watery blue eyes of his wife, at her small, sad smile and he held her for a long time. “I love you and I miss you,” Herb said, finally.</p>

<p>	“I know,” Sarah said. “Build something... Get out your tools,  you’ll feel better.” </p>

<p>	Herb began work on a back porch the next day. The project would take him through the fall to complete.</p>

<p><h4>* * *</h4></p>

<p>	The same night Herb Nofsinger saw his deceased wife, something strange and inexplicable happened to Andy Sumner who was sitting up in bed reading Mad Magazine. His older brother Karl, who was two years dead from a factory accident came into his room.</p>

<p>	Karl stood by the door, bashfully looking at a poster Andy had taped up of a super model. Karl was always smiling and he was smiling now, his crooked teeth going in all directions, his eyes twinkling. Some people thought Karl was retarded, but Karl was just nice. He was too nice. Maybe he was gullible, but his big brother wasn’t dumb like everyone thought.</p>

<p>	Andy dropped his magazine and felt tears blur up his eyes. So much that he couldn’t even see his brother anymore. He wiped them away quickly, afraid that Karl would disappear.</p>

<p>	“Hey big brother,” Andy said.</p>

<p>	“Hey... Hey...” Karl said.</p>

<p>	“What—What are you doing?”</p>

<p>	Andy’s eyes traveled to Karl’s hands. The hands that caught in the machine. His hands were fine.</p>

<p>	“I used to say you drew funny,” Karl said. The smile remained on his face but what he said was serious. Andy could tell that.</p>

<p>	“Yeah, they were dumb pictures...” Andy said.</p>

<p>	“You haven’t drawn in a while,” Karl said.</p>

<p>	“Yeah, I know... It’s stupid anyway...”</p>

<p>	“I shouldn’t have told you they were dumb,” Karl said. He looked away.</p>

<p>	“Yeah?”</p>

<p>	“They’re good. They’re real good,” Karl said. “You should draw... A lot.”</p>

<p>	“Oh, OK,” Andy said. He stood up. He wanted to hug his brother. He wanted something.
<br>	
<br>When he got close though, Karl moved back.</p>

<p>	“You’re not dumb either, Karl.” But Karl was already disappearing. “I love you...” Andy said. And then Karl was gone.</p>

<p><h4>* * *</h4></p>

<p>	It was the same way with David Kane—a presence from the afterlife visited him also. David didn’t recognize this presence though, not at first. When he left a friend’s party that night, he found a middle-aged man sitting in the passenger seat of his old Trans Am.</p>

<p>	David leapt out of the car when he realized this. He was all nerves and fear. Adrenaline flooded his circuitry, burning off most of his drunkenness.</p>

<p>	“What the hell? What the hell?” he kept saying.</p>

<p>	“Calm down,” the old guy said. “I know your mother. I know Jamie...”</p>

<p>	David looked at the guy. He had a large gut on him. There were dark circles under his eyes. He was wearing a baseball uniform that looked like it was from the forties.</p>

<p>	“Who are you?” David said.</p>

<p>	“Get in the car, I’ll tell ya. You drive.”</p>

<p>	“I’m not going anywhere,” David said.</p>

<p>	The man sighed. He shook a cigarette out of a pack and lit it. He exhaled a cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>	“Son, we ain’t got all night,” he said.</p>

<p>	“Are you kidnapping me? Is this some kind of extortion thing?” David said.</p>

<p>	The man looked at him. “You drive, we talk. You drive wherever you like.”</p>

<p>	David got in the car and started it.</p>

<p>	“Who are you?” David said.</p>

<p>	“I’m dead,” the man said.</p>

<p>	David thought he might believe this.</p>

<p>	He drove around for a few blocks. When they got close to David’s house, the man told him to pull over.</p>

<p>	“I don’t want nothing,” the man said. “Except one thing—you gotta choice—you play baseball or you become an alcoholic ex-jock with a factory job. You become dead, like me.”</p>

<p>	“Who are you?” David said.</p>

<p>	“Charlie,” the man said. “Your mother’s uncle. I died at thirty-three—my liver. I was a ballplayer. You’ll notice I’m not wearing a Major League uniform...”</p>

<p>	The man tossed out his cigarette. A June bug flew into the car.</p>

<p>	“Don’t be like me,” Charlie said. “Play ball.”</p>

<p><h4>* * *</h4></p>

<p>	Andrea Mitchell thought she might be better off dead.</p>

<p>	She hated her life. She hated her gun-nut father. She hated how she was fat and flat-chested. She hated how boys ignored her. She hated most of the kids at her high school. She hated the entire town of McKinley. About the only thing that made her forget these things was her cello playing. She was in orchestra at the high school.</p>

<p>	She went to the Summer Fest in hopes of seeing one of the only people she liked—Brett Jones from school. Brett was playing the band shell at one p.m. with his band Rising Sons.</p>

<p>	In her mind she had planned how it might go. She would stand at the front of the stage and make sure Brett knew she was there. After the set, she’d rush up and tell Brett what a great guitar player he was and everything. </p>

<p>	When she got to the Fest and saw Brett, he was unloading equipment from a van with Tim Janski and Jim Kohout. She was planning on going up to ask if they needed help but then she saw Courtney Gray. </p>

<p>	Courtney Gray grabbed Brett around the waist and kissed his neck. Brett turned around and grabbed her and practically sucked her face off.</p>

<p>	Andrea wasn’t in the mood to see Rising Sons after that. She went to another part of the Fest, got some chili and sat on a park bench where she watched a couple play tennis.</p>

<p>	Now at home in her room, Andrea thought she might just take a bottle of aspirin or throw herself into Dixmoor River.</p>

<p>	These and other dark thoughts were swirling around her head when her dead sister Lisa came into the room. Lisa was four years older than Andrea. She was killed by a drunk driver. Her hair was long and straight just like it was on the day she died.</p>

<p>	“No, Andrea,” Lisa said. “Don’t do it.”</p>

<p>	“Why not?” Andrea said. “There’s nothing here for me...”</p>

<p>	“Maybe not here,” Lisa said. “But somewhere else.”</p>

<p>	“Where?”</p>

<p>	“This is only one period in your life,” Lisa said. “There will be other periods. Better periods. New places. New people. Wonderful experiences.”</p>

<p>	“How do you know that?”</p>

<p>	“I just do,” Lisa said. “Don’t you want to find out what happens to you?”</p>

<p>	“Not if it involves living here.”</p>

<p>	“You’ll leave one day,” Lisa said. </p>

<p>	“How?”</p>

<p>	“Your music will carry you,” Lisa said. </p>

<p><h4>* * *</h4></p>

<p>	Kenneth Jackson, who made a modest but pleasant living selling hot dogs and chili from his store front on Wildwood Street did not sample his own chili the day of the McKinley Summer Fest.</p>

<p>	Because of this, he would never learn about the strange effect his sales produced and would never know that he was only a few spoonfuls away from being visited by his deceased father, Earl.</p>

<p>	Since Earl was not known for his friendly disposition or tolerance but rather for his abrasive, abusive and unstable behavior, it was just as well this visit did not take place.</p>

<p>	Things were pretty good in Kenneth’s life, all things considered. </p>

<p>	He didn’t need his father’s advice.</p>
