<h2>Peanuts  and The Amazing  Gro-Beast</h2>
	<h3>Chris Bower</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>When my beast arrived, it was three in the afternoon and I was sitting in my underwear, on the phone. I was reading a poem I had just written about a 21st century cowboy sitting naked next to a campfire, to my friend Peanuts, who was somewhat of a cowboy himself and used to edit a literary journal called Erotic Dust which I have never seen but like all journals you’ve never seen, you’ve heard good things. While I finished listening to Peanuts’ comments, I heard the mail lady slide letters through the slot. </p>

<p>It arrived in a yellow legal sized envelope. I remember the color distinctly, because it is rare that I receive legal sized envelopes, so when I do, I pay attention to the color and remember them. For example, when I ordered a blindfold that you could see through, off a TV ad, it arrived in a shiny black legal envelope. I was going to use it to win the endless number of contests that involved the use of a blindfold but this turned out not to be a prosperous venture. I had no idea that everyone in the world knew not to trust a man that brings his own blindfold. I thought maybe it might at least be of use if I was ever put in front of a firing squad. If I could see the bullets, I thought, I might have a better chance of avoiding them. I explained my reasoning to my friend Alex and he advised that I should never again repeat those words. “But Alex,” I argued, “If I can’t see, then I have no chance at all to…” And before I finished my sentence, he pinned me down to the floor with his knee and tied my hands behind my back with his belt. He then stood me up and put the blind fold over my eyes. He then pushed me down on the bed and gave me a violent but surprisingly successful blowjob. He threw me around the room and I looked down at him through the black fabric and we looked like one delirious creature, malfunctioning. </p>

<p>Normally, my penis when fully aroused is the size of three poorly stacked water chestnuts, but this day, for some reason, through the fabric, it looked as it had grown to be over six hundred percent its original size. I did not announce my surprise to Alex for fear it would ruin the moment, and while it is true that I was highly aroused by the blowjob, it was mainly glee that made my mouth make such a ghastly racket. </p>

<p>I know this sex scene might come as a little surprising because I hadn’t told you that I was already nude and that Alex was just in his jeans and that we were already in the process of making out when I began defending my blindfold. The truth is, I wasn’t gay and he wasn’t gay but we were in our late 20’s, lonely, experimenting, playing strip poker for favors, when things just got a little out of hand. Before he left my room that day, never to return, he said, “This is the only God damn reason to have that fucking thing.”  </p>

<p>That day I learned that it is very difficult to untie your own hands and despite the comedy that ensues in movies, when the tied up naked man looks to his neighbors for discreet assistance, I assure you that this situation brings you nothing but sadness and loss. It was just bad luck that my neighbors kids were just getting dropped off by the school bus, and it was just poor timing that I happened to be in the middle of the street, jumping up and down, my feet bloody from rocks and broken glass, and it was just plain horrible that my neighbor happened to be looking out of the window, and just happened to see me next to his young kids, yelling at the top of my lungs, bouncing up and down naked on the street with my hands tied behind my back and a blindfold around my eyes, and it was just fucking awful when he pulled out his handgun and fired a shot at me. Time slowed down when I heard the blast, and through the fabric I saw the silver bullet flying at my head and I hit the deck. In actuality, the bullet probably would have hit my leg had I not ducked, but because I did, it went right through my shoulder and into the mouth of one of his kids. I slowed down the bullet for him, yes, but not enough. The kid must have been smiling at the time because it didn’t touch his lips but broke all his front teeth. </p>

<p>When asked about having seen the bullet going towards my head, the only answer I had was that, despite the fact that I could see through the blindfold, it didn’t really fix the problem that even with my glasses on, I have very poor eyesight and below average eye-hand coordination. </p>

<p>In the hospital I missed Alex a lot. I kept the blindfold next to my bed and used it as a tear rag. I noticed, the more I used the blindfold, the bigger it got and when I had to use it to soak up an unusually large RC cola spill in my hospital bed, it grew to be about six hundred percent it’s original size and I had to hide it under my bed. That night, I could feel it growing underneath me, pushing the bed up like it was trying to stand. The next morning, it was small again and the white hospital floor was dark and sticky. I tried the blindfold on and it stuck against my eyebrows and I could feel my eyelashes clinging to the fabric. When I opened my eyes to see through, I could barely make out the fluorescents above. When I was released and went back home, back in the black it went, cola soaked, never to be seen through or seen again by me, unless I one day begin forgetting my envelopes. </p>

<p>So the beast arrived in a yellow envelope right when I finished reading my cowboy poem. The poem, which comes in at about 87 pages, had taken me over three hours to write and over two hours to read. I went through a lot of tough decisions, writing this poem, creative decisions. Below is a poetic re-enactment of my creative process:</p>

<p><blockquote>It was late, dark and lonely on the ranch 
<br>the stars, the sky, looked like a giant fucked up mouth 
<br>pieces of expensive looking teeth 
<br>floating on top of a lot of black blood 
<br>The sky had just been punched 
<br>and its teeth were flying 
<br>If you wanted to 
<br>you could just pluck them out with your fingers 
<br>without even standing up 
<br>and stick them in your mouth 
<br>But my cowboy, on the dark, lonely ranch 
<br>was not concerned with the sky 
<br>He was not holding a shotgun listening for coyotes and poachers 
<br>My cowboy sat naked on a dirty black log next to a dwindling campfire 
<br>He sat so close, his leg hairs were getting singed 
<br>smoke poured into his eyes but he just waved it away 
<br>At first I had him eating bald eagle tacos with Tabasco sauce 
<br>and then I thought that was boring 
<br>so then I had him reading Harpers Magazine 
<br>shaking his head in disbelief 
<br>at a Harpers Index statistic 
<br>that was about the ratio of pennies, nickels, and dimes 
<br>dropped into wishing wells 
<br>There was no mention of quarters 
<br>The cowboy, outraged 
<br>insisted, to the fire 
<br>that he always dropped quarters into wells 
<br>And then a paragraph into the editorial 
<br>he screamed, God damn you Lapham 
<br>and threw the magazine into the fire 
<br>and for some reason 
<br>It didn’t burn 
<br>but began to grow 
<br>up to six hundred percent its original size 
<br>And then I was going to have the geeky writing staff 
<br>walk out of the fire to defend their coin statistics 
<br>but then I got bored again, 
<br>shrunk the magazine back down 
<br>hurled it into the fire 
<br>watched it get small 
<br>and went back to work 
<br>which basically means closing my eyes 
<br>until I see what I want to write </blockquote></p>

<p>My cowboy was still naked 
<br>sitting on a black log, his leg hairs getting singed by the fire 
<br>He wasn’t concerned with the sky. 
<br>His only concerns 
<br>were the pictures he had taken of women’s feet and ankles 
<br>with his camera phone the last time he was in the Wal-Mart shoe department 
<br>He walked by the women 
<br>held the camera down near his knee 
<br>shot often and aimed low 
<br>By the end of the day he had about a hundred good ones 
<br>and that late, dark, lonely night 
<br>he just kept flipping through them 
<br>He was especially fond of the ones 
<br>where the women had little cuts and bruises 
<br>He flipped the photos so fast 
<br>he barely had time to take them in. 
<br>This was tough on his battery 
<br>and when his phone started running low 
<br>he stood up, closed his phone, took off his hat 
<br>and jerked off into the fire 
<br>At first I described the semen to fire relationship as an insignificant sizzle 
<br>but then I went back and changed it 
<br>to a giant explosion that started the greatest wildfire known to modern man 
<br>This, I thought, as I typed 
<br>as the great semen wildfire tore through the ranch 
<br>through the cows and towns and into the cities 
<br>I thought to myself 
<br>This is probably the greatest poem ever written 
<br></p><p>I called Peanuts and read the poem to him over the phone. He only had one suggestion for me. “Make that fire a woman Son, and you’ve got one hell of a poem.” </p>

<p>I had seen the beast advertised in the back of Harpers Magazine. What really struck me was that it was the only color ad on the page. “The Amazing Gro-Beast” it shouted to me in a bold red font, “Grows Over Six Hundred Percent Larger in Water.” And because it was Harpers Magazine, most of the ad consisted of smartly written copy in cool black letters. “Great for a class measuring or graphing project or makes a super demonstration. Your Gro-Beast is made from a polymer molecule that has an outstanding ability to absorb water. The water molecules move into the “beast” molecules because there is less water on the inside of the beast then there is on the outside. This causes the beast to grow and causes you to say, Wow.” </p>

<p>      Before I finished reading I was already on the phone with the saleslady, grilling her on the beast.  I asked her questions like, “Is there any chance that I might be in any danger if my beast outgrows me?”  There is no chance. “Is it possible to get a beast that gets smaller instead of bigger?” Not possible. “Do you think I could get you guys to make a Gro-Beast version of me?” Yes, but it would be very expensive. “Do you sell Gro-Houses or apartments that my beast could live in?” No. “Are you married?” None of your business. “Do you take credit cards?” Yes. </p>

<p>The woman on the phone explained to me when I explained to her that I only wanted to buy one Gro-Beast, that each beast is only fifty nine cents, but that it would cost me six dollars in shipping and handling. If I wanted to buy ten Gro-Beasts, she said, it would only cost two dollars more. “What the hell am I going to do with ten beasts I screamed, “when all I want is one?”  I felt like Steve Martin in that movie, and I started tearing my hair out of my scalp and crying all over the floor, just like Steve Martin in that movie, and the saleslady passed the phone call onto her manager, which is the phone sales equivalent of calling the police and having me thrown in jail. </p>

<p>The manager, he had a really deep voice, and he told me to calm down and explain my situation. I told him I only wanted one beast and didn’t care about the cost.  Why can’t a man just get what he wants when he wants it? He explained that she was just doing her job and trying to save me some money. He would be happy, however, to put my order through as I wanted. He had such a soothing voice, I couldn’t help but close my eyes. While my eyes were closed, that’s when I figured it out. This deep voiced manager was the saleslady’s husband. They were a team and I was just one man. “You and your wife,” I said, “You’ve been together so long that you forgot what it’s like to just be you. You might need ten beasts to fill your God damn mansion, but I’m only one man, and I only need one beast. Are you sure that this is not going to put me in any danger? I have a really small apartment.” </p>

<p>“What color beast would you like, Sir?” </p>

<p>“Green,” I screamed. </p>

<p>“Green,” I screamed in happiness when I opened my yellow package. I had been waiting for days, trying to decide which jar would best suit my beast. I finally settled on this purple glass vase I have with a picture of Pope John Paul the 2nd. I thought it would make a wonderful womb for my beast. It would offer him a colourful but spiritual atmosphere in which to grow. I think I would have better off if I had grown up inside a purple Polish faced vase. At least then, I could have had a little genuine culture, instead of growing up, first inside a foolishly patriotic woman, and secondly, in a dusty old house where everything, even the shower curtains and oven mitts, were made out of old American flags. </p>

<p>I followed the instructions carefully. I filled the bottom of the vase with clean room temperature water. I put my beast in the aforementioned water at exactly 10:27 AM and waited. In a few hours, they said, it would begin growing. I made myself a homemade milkshake and watched. At 12:27 PM, my beast still had not stirred. I called a friend in a panic. I accidentally called him Alex and he hung up on me. I called my Mom and she told me that she was right in the middle of something and couldn’t talk. “What could be more important than this?” She calmly explained that she was currently saluting a rainbow. </p>

<p>“Why, Mom?” </p>

<p>“Because that’s how God blesses America, dear. You do know that we are the only nation in the world that is blessed with rainbows, right?” </p>

<p>I rarely hang up on people and this was no exception. She hung up on me after I heard her say, “God Bless you, Sir,” to what I assume was the sky. </p>

<p>Nobody could help me. Eight hours and eleven milkshakes later, it was 10:27 PM and my beast still hadn’t grown an inch.  I had already called the Gro-Beast help-line and it was a recorded message, repeating the same shit on the box. Clean water. The people at the sales center said they would take the beast back but I would have to send it back before I would get a new one.  “Did you use clean water?” they asked. I changed the water. I went to the store and bought bottled water. </p>

<p>Sixteen hours later, it was 2:27 PM and I was drinking beershakes, staring down, and still nothing. Twenty hours later, it was 10:27 AM and I was drinking wineshakes and crying so hard I could barely see. I picked my beast up out of the water and held it up my eye. It looked like it was a little smaller. </p>

<p>Twenty six hours later, it was 12:27 PM and I was soaking the beast in my tears. Polymers suck up urine too and that’s mostly water, right? Tears are just basically urine that comes out of your face, right? There shouldn’t be any problems, right, but are my tears clean? Not clean exactly, but not filthy, right? Do people have dirty tears? </p>

<p>Thirty six hours later, it was 12:27 AM and I was feeling suicidal, so I invited my friend Peanuts over to help me. We called him Peanuts because his ears are deformed and look like giant cartoonish peanut shells. Don’t get confused about Peanuts though, he’s a tough son of a bitch, and when he arrived, he did it in grand Peanuts style, riding a horse through my open front door with a shotgun in one hand and a colourful coffee cup in the other. </p>

<p>“What’s the problem kid?” he asked, taking off his cowboy hat. </p>

<p>“My beast won’t grow.” </p>

<p>“Did you try soaking it in whisky?” </p>

<p>“I don’t have any.” </p>

<p>“Let me see that thing,” he said and I handed him the vase. </p>

<p>Peanuts calmly turned over the Pope so his head was upside down and emptied my tears onto the floor. He used his fingers to strain the beast. He then emptied his coffee cup into the vase and said, “And now we wait.” </p>

<p>Peanuts, you have to understand, never gets off of his horse. He even sleeps on his horse. I sat on the floor watching Peanut hold the vase in his dirty weathered hands and before I could muster up the courage to ask, he did the asking. “Do you want to sit up here with me son?” </p>

<p>“Yes,” I said and climbed up on a chair and jumped up behind him. I rested my head on his back and closed my eyes. </p>

<p>“It’s going to be alright” he said. </p>

<p>Two hours later, at 2:27 AM, I woke up, bobbed my head a few times and yelled out, “Peanuts, Peanuts, is he growing?” </p>

<p>“No, son,” he said. “He actually looks a little smaller.” </p>

<p>Peanuts dipped his fingers into the whisky and pulled out the tiny green beast. Before I could object, he grabbed the beast by its tail and dropped it in his mouth. He sucked on it for a minute, held it in his cheek like a squirrel and said coolly, “I know why this beast isn’t growing Son.” </p>

<p>“Why Peanuts?”, I asked. “Why?” </p>

<p>“Because that Son, is no polymer. That little beast was real.” </p>

<p>He spit it out and when he showed it me, it was just a green bony mush in the whisky. </p>

<p>Things got really quiet for a while. A few minutes later, I couldn’t stand it and I broke the silence. “Real, like me and you Peanuts?” I asked and burst into tears. </p>

<p>He was silent for a couple seconds and then he laughed, and so did his horse. They laughed for a long time, a really long time, and after a while, just like on TV, I started to laugh and my laughing increased steadily until I was rolling around on the floor cackling. I was still laughing even after Peanuts dropped me down off his horse, strained the remaining whisky back into his cup and made his way back out through the front door. When they were gone, the door was still open, and I looked out over the trees and into the sky, and it was blue. The clouds were red and drooping down like they were melting and the sunlight through the window hit my purple vase with a violent light. The vase glowed and it looked like the Pope’s head was going to burst into flames that would envelope the room. I wished it did but it didn’t. </p>
