<h2>The Day I Went Temporarily Blind</h2>
	<h3>Thomas Mundt</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>On my sixth birthday, my friends and I played Freeze Tag at dusk and I ran into a clothesline.  My head snapped back and I landed flat on my back, knocking the wind out of me.  Worse, the dry rope left a nasty burn across my eyelids.  It hurt like hell and when my lungs returned I howled for my dad to come scrape me off the lawn.</p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>I sat on the couch between my mom and dad and they took turns holding ice cubes wrapped in a damp washcloth against my eyelids.  They did so one eye at a time so that I could watch the last few innings of the Cubs game.  I kept falling asleep because the game was a late one against the Dodgers, part of a nine-game West Coast roadtrip.  I eventually woke up in my dad’s arms, carrying me off to bed as Harry Caray called a Bowa-to-Sandberg-to-Durham double-play.</p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>When I woke up the next day, everything was peach-colored. I tried to open my eyes but I couldn’t. My eyelids had pussed up overnight and sealed my eyelids shut. I reached up to touch them and felt a layer of crust. I thrashed around beneath the covers and yelled for my dad to get the hell in my room and give me my sight back.</p>

<p>I heard my parents’ heavy footsteps on the hardwood floor, followed by the sound of the door slamming against the wall as they burst into my bedroom.  I heard my dad tell my mom he’d be right back and I followed his footsteps down the hall and into the kitchen.  Then I felt my mom take my hand, gently sandwiching it between hers.  She shooshed me and told me to breathe.</p>

<p>When my dad returned my mom told me to hold still.  Then I felt something cold and metallic sawing into my eyelashes, debris hitting my corneas.  When I could finally open both eyes, I saw my dad standing over me with a butter knife in his right hand.</p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>Once my pajamas were on I ran out the back door.  I looked at my swingset, our garage.  They were still there.  I looked up at the sky.  Still blue, with a sun and some clouds affixed to it.  I looked down at my hands.  They were covered in a sticky translucent goo from peeling an orange.</p>

<p>Things were in order.  My blindness had passed.  I ran back into the house and jammed Burgertime into my Colecovision and played video games until my thumbs got sore.</p>
