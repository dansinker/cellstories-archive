<h2>Betty the Zombie</h2>
	<h3>Elizabeth Crane </h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>Betty the zombie wants to change.  How her husband knows this is he asked her and she said, Eeeeeeeehhhh! which after a long process of trial and error he determined to mean yes.  Betty the zombie’s husband, Ed, loves her very much, but finds it hard to help her meet her special needs while also not becoming a zombie himself. </p>

<p>The backstory on Betty and Ed is this.  They had been high school sweethearts. Ed was the kind of average-looking guy no one noticed one way or another, the type who might have bumped up into handsome if he’d had any style at all, but he hadn’t.  Betty was pretty in that sort of way where there’s nothing really wrong with her and nothing really outstanding about her although she did have really shiny hair that she wore in a nice flip.  She thought it was shiny because she used Prell but really it was just because.  Ed had the locker next to Betty’s and noticed her shiny hair one day and she noticed that he was in the A.V. club which she thought was really cool which gives you an idea of both Betty and Ed.  Even Ed knew A.V. wasn’t cool.  Ed was also really into racewalking, which Betty did know wasn’t cool but she liked that he was physically fit.  Betty and Ed continued on to Lombard Junior College where Ed dropped out after one semester to go into the family business of rivets even though he had hoped to someday pursue being a television producer.  It sounded exciting, although Ed never did know exactly what that meant or how to go about it, and a search of the Tribune classifieds that turned up nothing proved enough to discourage him back into rivets.  Betty transferred from LJC to a secretarial school because she was told by her mother that every girl should have typing to fall back on.  Betty didn’t have much of an idea at that time what she wanted to fall forward onto, and had some resistance to the idea of typing for a living, but didn’t have any better ideas.  Plus she was a good girl so she usually did what her mom said even if it made her a little bit bitter inside.  They were married at the Lombard County Courthouse as soon as Betty graduated typing school.  Betty wore a cream-colored maxi-dress she crocheted herself and Ed wore sandals and a daisy in his lapel.  That tells you what time it was.  It sounds like they were hippies but they weren’t. </p>

<p>Betty and Ed tried to have kids right away and they kept trying for a long time and the long and short of it is that it just never happened.  One time Betty missed her period and gained ten pounds and they were hopeful, but it was for naught.  It was only because Betty really liked Pringles.  They stacked.  Betty learned to knit during this time and knitted a lot of hats and booties but mostly she just accumulated a lot of yarn, and then she accumulated a lot of hats and booties that were never to be worn.  But still Betty and Ed were more or less happy, considering their childlessness.  They got a dog and that helped a little.  They called him Boone.</p>

<p>How she became a zombie was when Betty was trying on some clothes at Target and another zombie took a bite out of her as she was coming out of the dressing room.  Although Betty and Ed were aware of a recent outbreak of zombies downstate, this woman did not look to Betty like a zombie, but either way, think about it, when the woman took this bite out of her she was quite alarmed.  At first Betty and Ed did not put it together.  Lombard, Illinois was a typically unremarkable suburb.  There had been no reports of zombies anywhere in the greater Chicagoland area even, so they at first assumed this woman, who was never caught, had simply been mad.  Betty went to the doctor and he stitched it up and prescribed some antibiotics but it wasn’t long before the wound began to fester and grow and when Ed would say, ‘What do you want for dinner,’ Betty was having to fight a peculiar impulse to tell her husband that what she wanted most for dinner involved a big heaping portion of Ed.  So instead for a while they ate a lot of steak and Betty would eat hers ‘rare’ which Ed happened to notice was more like if Betty had taken the steak and waved it over the grill for a second, at a height of two feet. </p>

<p>What was bad was when one of the little neighbor boys went missing and a few days later Ed found a little neighbor-boy sized striped t-shirt in their laundry which was when he began to suspect Betty and when he finally confronted her she tried to act like it was no big deal.  ‘He was so ssshmmall,’ she said. ‘I didn’t think anyone would missh him.’  Except for her eyes said she knew it really was a big deal.  It was at this time that Ed also noticed a slight slurring of her speech. </p>

<p>Ed started sleeping in the den which was when Betty started looking through the Yellow Pages for a therapist.  She called a number of therapists but could not find any that specialized in zombies.  While Ed was sleeping in the den was when he saw the show Relight the Fire of You on Lifetime and got the idea for Betty to go on the show.  On this show seven women with problems to solve are chosen to live in a mansion in sunny Miami Beach Florida.  What they do is they pair the women up with life coaches.  A big thing is they also have to deal with each other.  <i>Because women aren’t always nice, but they are always you</i>, the breathy voice over says during the soft-focus montage at the beginning of the show, as though it actually means something.  Considering that the soft-focus montage shows a multi-cultural variety of women smiling and hugging and planting flowers and other things that look quite nice, actually.  Sometimes they offer the women traditional therapy on an as-needed basis.  Also the life coaches give them group challenges and invididually designed exercises just for each woman and their particular problem.  Also the life coaches hire a variety of ‘experts’ to come in and help them with their problems.  An expert being defined here as ‘someone who does something’.  Because <i>‘like a flower’ no two women are alike</i> (also from the montage v.o.) and as follows no two problems are alike and therefore no two solutions should be alike, is what the producers of this show think.  What happens is the women stay in the house and work on the problems for however long it takes and so people come and go except or until it’s the end of the TV season and then they’re S.O.L.  Then they have to take the summer off like the crew and come back in the fall season.</p>

<p>Ed drives Betty in to Chicago for a casting call at the Marriott.  There are probably a thousand people waiting to be seen by the casting directors, but as soon as her number comes up, by way of introducing herself, Betty barely has to say Beaaaaaaah! before she’s cast right away because Relight the Fire of You is currently not getting such good ratings and they have never had a woman with a zombie problem before which they expect will be a draw.  Betty and Ed have a somber goodbye, but agree that it’s the best thing for both of them.</p>

<p>There are already six women in the house when Betty the zombie comes in.  This group of women has issues of: severe clutter, severe overspending, being unable to gain weight, loneliness, prostitution, and murdering.  And a few combinations thereof such as Betty the zombie also has a murdering problem due to her dietary needs, but not because she likes murdering, really.  She likes it when she eats, but she suffers remorse.  Betty and Ed are sworn to secrecy about the neighbor boy and are thus far not suspected as the prime suspect in the neighbor boy’s disappearance is a creepy uncle in Ohio who hasn’t been seen either.  Besides the boy, Betty swears she has only eaten live animals.  Raaaaaaaaaysh! she will explain, meaning to say ‘Strays’, hoping that the eating of stray cats and dogs is somehow not as bad as eating pets with owners, or children.  Still, Ed keeps a close eye on Boone.</p>

<p>On the day that a newcomer enters the house they do what they call a ‘greeting’ which is the newcomer tells the reason why they’re there.  This is hard for Betty because she has so much trouble talking.  She will also get speech therapy.  For now she has a zombie translator who is also a zombie but who has a particularly good speaking ability.  The zombie moans and groans a lot and the zombie translator explains that Betty has come primarily because of the marital issues that have arisen as a result of her being a zombie and also because of her desire not to eat any more pets.</p>

<p>Betty’s roommate is the girl who couldn’t gain weight.  She’s a pretty sweet girl, nineteen, tall and thin, obviously, but guess what, nobody feels sorry for her because most of them have issues of being unable to lose weight, and so they kind of hate her which is a big part of her problem both in and out of the mansion.  ‘Boo hoo’ and ‘Poor you’ are the sorts of things they say to her no matter whether if she’s talking about having to buy clothes in the kid’s department or her alcoholic mother and sexually abusive stepbrother.  This girl, Linda, is a good pairing with Betty for the obvious reason of her having nothing much to offer Betty in the way of being something she’d ever want to eat.  But also because Linda is so sweet, and although Betty has the severely advanced speech problems at this point whereby it’s hard to tell what her feelings are toward anyone, Linda correctly has the sense that Betty does not hate her.  How she can tell this is Betty pats her on the head before they go to sleep.  Betty patting someone on the head is kind of like when a two-year-old pats a dog, no control over the arms and more like hitting than patting, but Linda senses the intention and smiles and Betty makes a noise something like Oooo-aaaaii that Linda takes to mean good night, even if it doesn’t. </p>

<p>The life coach assigned to deal with Betty asks her to clarify what her goals are, both inside the mansion and for after ‘reignition’ which is their term for when someone leaves the house.  The translator ascertains for the life coach that Betty has a goal of not desiring to eat her husband or her dog and getting in touch with her childhood passion for sewing and other needle crafts, possibly starting a business.  Betty the zombie’s life coach gives her the assignment of choosing two pieces of fabric from a large selection of colors and patterns and then sewing them together and she is to do this with one simple seam on a sewing machine.   Important aspects of this exercise being both what the color and pattern choice say about her and also how straight she gets her seam.  Betty chooses a lovely blue toile with a coordinating solid blue, which suggest to the life coach a desire for stability balanced with a touch of melancholy as represented by the color blue, and her seam is impressively straight except for it is sewn directly onto her hand.  ‘Alright,’ says the fiftyish life coach (who, just for a better picture, has a largeish if obviously natural bosom that is usually offset by a variety of low cut, brightly colored tops from Forever 21), acting as though anyone’s ever seen this before, ‘good, let’s just move on,’ and endeavors to use a seam ripper to remove the fabric from Betty’s hand, with grisly results.  Betty moans and pulls her hand away, leaving bits of her palm in the hand of her life coach. </p>

<p>Betty’s initial daily group encounter is not much more productive.  Most of the women are visibly uncomfortable with Betty and even the murderer thinks herself better.  It might be noted that Gloria, the murderer, ran over her husband with their lawn mower, and had wanted to plead not guilty but instead took a plea bargain (serving nine years and now trying to reenter society and engage in new relationships via online dating) when strong evidence showed her malicious intent.  Nevertheless she feels entitled to judge other murderers and when she comments about the grotesque nature of Betty’s appetite, Betty groans something like ‘Ouuaahhhhhh!’ and then under her breath (which for a zombie tends not to be subtle), ‘Behhhh,’ which the zombie translator explains means, ‘I can’t help it!  Bitch.’  Sweet underweight Linda tries to come to Betty’s defense and Gloria tells her to shut her skinny ass up. </p>

<p>Ruthann, the woman with the clutter issue, is annoying her roommate, Connie, the woman with the overspending issue, who doesn’t have issues with clutter because among many other things, she has spent a lot of money at the Container Store.  Ruthann has the unique ability to enter a tidy room and dismantle everything in it in a manner of minutes.  It simply does not occur to her to ‘Put it back where you found it, bitch-ass slob’ even though that’s exactly what Connie says to her about every six seconds.  It occurs to Ruthann to leave it wherever and to wonder why anyone cares.  The life coaches have suggested to Ruthann that she is metaphorically ‘leaving’ pieces of herself behind in the items she scatters in her wake; Ruthann so far isn’t hearing this and maintains only that she is in the house because her apartment was declared uninhabitable by the health department, and that if it were up to her, the lifestyle of clutter would suit her ‘sense of freedom’ just fine.  Betty the zombie ends up identifying with Connie the overspending woman because when Connie asks Betty exactly what she had gone to Target for (lustily, like a sober drunk asking for details of a bender), Gloria points out that it seems as though Betty might have spent a pretty penny at Target that day had she not been intercepted by the zombie.  As it was, Betty had gone to Target directly from her other favorite store, Costco, where she had spent in the vicinity of three hundred dollars which if you’ve never been to Costco is more or less enough to fill Betty and Ed’s two-car garage.  Betty and Ed do have a big home with lots of storage in the basement, and so she buys stuff on special and often in bulk telling herself she’s saving money when really they will probably in their entire lives never use all the toilet paper in their basement, and that’s just the toilet paper, we’re not even getting into the craft supplies that have long occupied the entire attic, and, truth be told, Betty kind of likes the feeling she has inside the cavernous walls of Costco, like she’s a part of something larger than herself, like if she picks up enough four-packs of Crest, a part of Costco will be with her.  So via the translator Betty discovers that her issues are even more complex than she had originally known.  Unfortunately, once you become a zombie you have a whole new set of issues above and beyond overspending, and also there’s no known antidote to being a zombie although there are new and exciting ways of coping with being a zombie that are emerging daily.  Many of them involve specially designed garments to conceal and contain wounds from growing worse during typical daily activities.  One possibility that is presented is that of medication, but Betty rejects this option because she does not want the possible side effects of weight gain and decreased sexual appetite.  (Nevermind that Ed’s sexual appetite has been nonexistent due to Betty’s perpetually open wounds being something he can’t quite get around.)</p>

<p>Rolonda, the woman with severe loneliness shares the large master bedroom with both Gloria the murderess and also Marny, the woman trying not to be a prostitute, which again is designed by the life coaches as being opposite enough to get the women to deal with their issues together.  Marny the prostitute is not shy, right, neither is Gloria the murderess as we’ve already seen.  Rolonda simply finds it hard to be in the same room as someone else. </p>

<p>Soon after Betty’s arrival, for an exercise in ‘group dynamics’ the women are gathered for a game of ‘Electric Fence Limbo’ which is exactly what it sounds like.  Each round, the electrified limbo pole is lowered until all of the women are eliminated.  Betty loses in the first round when the pole is at neck height, due to her extremely limited ability to bend any part of herself, and when she senses (by way of a creak audible to the entire group) that she’s close to snapping her head straight off, she forfeits before her feet are barely under the pole.  Gloria, somewhat overweight, suffers a severe burn to her stomach, and is the second woman out.  The others lose unelectrified and Linda is the final woman to go under, however ‘There are no winners in the game of limbo’ the life coaches announce after it’s over.  ‘Only players.’  ‘What the hell does that mean?’ Ruthann asks.  ‘What do you think it means?’ the life coach asks her.  ‘I don’t think it means shit,’ Ruthann says.  ‘I think it means Gloria got electrocuted on TV.’  ‘Mmm,’ says the life coach nodding and squinting her eyes like she’s thinking except she really isn’t.  ‘Interesting…’ which is what she says when she gets caught but wants people to think she’s making the women think for themselves.  Betty wishes to herself that she’d known any of this before she played since she’d rather be a loser with her head on her shoulders. </p>

<p>Anyway, this is still about Betty the zombie but it’s important to know a little about what we’re dealing with because each of these women has some pretty deep-seated problems and as it turns out Betty will not be the last to be reignited.  Gloria, for one, has some resistance to admitting her murdering problems, Marny has solicited several members of the crew and one groundskeeper since entering the mansion, not to mention that she is deep into debt because her ‘agent’ (previous remark from Gloria to Marny regarding this word: ‘I think that dude was called a pimp last time I checked’) takes seventy percent and also because she has a habit of buying clothes instead of doing laundry.  (Snippet of previous conversation between Gloria and Marny about this problem: ‘What if you drop it off?’ ‘I don’t want people touching my lingerie.’ ‘Um, you’re a whore.’ ‘Murderer.’ ‘Whatever.’ ‘Whatever, I don’t kill people.’ ‘So you say.’ ‘You’d best step off, beeyotch.’ ‘Whatever.’)  Rolonda often stays in her room.  So this particular cast remains on this show for a long time, and it’s not an accident that the ratings do go up after Betty joins the cast.  Betty’s fan email box becomes full as soon as her first episode airs, not a few of them from other women struggling with being a zombie but also from non-zombie women who said they learned that zombies weren’t just undead but that they had feelings too.  Betty makes an effort to answer a few emails but breaks off her left pinky finger on the shift key and instead has the translator post a note to all her fans thanking them for their support and telling them that it means a lot.</p>

<p>There are times when Betty, who was always a pretty nice person and is still, in spite of her situation, feels patronized by the life coaches.  She rightly perceives the harsh judgment on the part of the life coaches who say that they aren’t judging her because <i>‘That’s totally not what this show is about,’</i> but really she can tell that they are judging her because of them being all, ‘Are you sure you really want to change because honestly it doesn’t matter to me’ at which time Betty gets in touch with some of her anger.  Betty openly mocks the tone of the life coach to her face, knowing that the coach cannot understand her, and that the zombie translator won’t give her away. </p>

<p>Betty has a few setbacks in the house like the night she sleepwalks into the master bedroom and is about to snack on Ruthann, the clutter woman, who also has a weight issue, until Rolonda with the loneliness spies her and shoos her out of the room with a shotgun.  (For which she receives a star on account of this being an important step in her dealing with other people.  ‘Because violence is an attempt to connect,’ the life coach says to the camera.)  Oh, each of the women (except for Gloria the murderess) had been given a shotgun upon Betty’s entry into the mansion, although the shotguns are actually loaded with blanks and serve only to shoo Betty away, and of course Betty is unaware of this since it wouldn’t work if she weren’t.  But there’s also a rotation of armed guards on set with Betty in the event that she does need to be rekilled for the protection of the cast and crew.</p>

<p>The issue of Betty’s diet is a much-debated problem.  In spite of a steady regimen of freshly deceased strays provided by the pound, Betty continues to try to sneak into her housemate’s rooms at night for some human.  She comes close to the bedside of Gloria the murdering woman, who is most dismayed to discover that her effort to rekill Betty results in nothing, due to the blanks, and although the guard shoots her in the back, this too results only in a spray of shoulder all over Gloria and loud moan from Betty as they remove her from the room.  Eventually a nutritionist is brought in who proposes that Betty’s jaw be wired shut for the safety of everyone and that she be fed a puree of blood and cow brains mixed with vitamins.  Betty reluctantly agrees but has some concerns about how the jaw-wiring will affect her sex life with Ed, not yet knowing that Ed isn’t really into getting a blowjob where there’s a chance that lips and tongue will be left behind on his dick anyway. </p>

<p>Eventually Connie the overspender calls Betty out on her deeper-lying issue of compulsive shopping and Betty is sent to a twelve-step group with Connie which is a breakthrough for Betty.  Over time she comes to realize that she had never properly mourned the loss of not having children.  Sobbing loudly and trying to talk at the same time, Betty says ‘OOOHHHAAAAYYYIII BOOOOOO DAAAAAAHH!!!’ Which the translator explains to the group that Betty is saying ‘Sometimes when Ed goes to work, I put the booties on the dog.’  Due to Betty’s childlessness and plus Boone the dog not being an entirely satsifactory baby substitute, she has been trying to fill a hole in herself with anything and everything, and according to the life coaches, ‘And isn’t it interesting how you manifested these holes in this other way…’ to which Betty thinks to tell the life coach to bite her, because even though she concedes that her being in the mansion is a good thing, she can get kind of irritated with the whole metaphor thing they seem to be all about.  Betty has unwittingly quit shopping cold turkey and understandably has been in the middle of complete withdrawal in the weeks since she became a zombie, which has exacerbated her overall problem.  Now that Betty has taken the first step in admitting to the group her ‘Ouaaalaaamaaaa!’ (powerlessness) over shopping she already feels a certain freedom, and that night in group she receives her first gold star, ten of which add up to reignition.  Through this revelation Betty comes to see that she is cross-addicted, recognizing her particular food issues as another she is powerless over, and this is the true beginning of her relighting the fire of her you. </p>

<p>However, speech and physical therapy prove more difficult for Betty the zombie.  Although her movement becomes slightly less stiff over time, her ability to express herself is so impaired that she has learned to master a specially designed oversized keyboard, one she can utilize without severing digits, and which has various special programs, one that allows her to write email through an advanced and complex use of emoticons and one that translates her thoughts into a sort of robotic speech.  Betty has a fight with Rolonda over use of the computer, resulting in another star for Rolonda, being as this is one of the only ways Rolonda connects with anyone, even if it is inmates at a maximum security prison (which she is told by the life coaches that she identifies with because she is so trapped in the prison of herself).  This fight with Rolonda is actually progress for both Betty and Rolonda, because Rolonda doesn’t run to her room and Betty is able to communicate ‘Maiiiii tuuuuhhh’ to Rolonda, which is one of the first times Betty is correctly understood using her own words by anyone in the house. </p>

<p>This is a wonderful day for Ed.  Her first message is a voice email to her husband that says ‘I love you so much Ed.  Thank you for not leaving me, Ed,’ Betty says in her computer generated monotone, and as she writes it she begins to shed her first tears since leaving Ed for the house, but which unfortunately ends up being rather messy as a good bunch of eye goo comes along with it.</p>

<p>Now that she has made some significant emotional progress, for practical matters, as an exercise in developing her artistic interests, Betty is enrolled in a papermaking class, which goes fairly well until she mashes her elbow through the screen.  At this point, given the issues Betty has with losing parts of herself, Betty is fitted with special gloves made out of a Teflon like material that allow her more range of motion without further injury.</p>

<p>At this point Betty has eight stars, which is when a housemate gets a makeover, usually a sign that a housemate is coming close to reignition.  Betty is excited about this because she has been especially self-conscious about both her hair, which not long ago had still been so shiny but was now dull and unruly (she’s not handy with a brush and cannot wash her hair by herself at all) and the extremely dark circles under her eyes, which are remedied quite easily with a heavy concealer.  She looks passable at first, from ten feet or from behind you might never suspect her condition, and the simplest possible grooming routine has been designed for her, but she has to practice a lot to keep it up.  On one of her first tries, a mascara wand gets stuck in her forehead, at which point it occurs to someone to just have Betty’s eyelashes dyed.  She is also given an entirely new wardrobe of clothes custom-made with Velcro closures for easier dressing.  Which comes none too soon as Betty finds it easier to remain in one outfit until it reeks than to take the chance of breaking off a limb trying to pull a sweater over her head.</p>

<p>But Betty the zombie is unable to get a tenth star for months, in spite of nothing but positive progress.  The truth is that the producers of the show don’t want her to reignite because she’s so popular, which she finds out by overhearing a crew member.  At this point Betty threatens to quit, explaining that she needs to get back to Ed and get on with her life and that she really doesn’t care whether she ‘reeeaggahhhh’ (reignites) or not because she’s ready to leave whatever you want to call it.  The producers send Betty a fruit basket in the hope that she will consider staying on just a while longer until perhaps they find another zombie with issues, but the basket wouldn’t have changed her mind even if it had had Pringles in it, which it hadn’t.  Betty makes a call to Ed who makes a call to a lawyer who makes a call to the producers to basically tell them that because of their using Betty the way they did they need to do a little better than a fruit basket like let’s just say you should think about giving Betty a spinoff or we will sue your asses five ways from Beelzebub.  After much discussion, the producers finally realize that giving Betty a spinoff could result in lots of money for them which is when Ed and Betty’s lawyer writes it into the new contract that Ed will be given a co-producer credit which is pretty much a happy ending for both Betty and Ed and the producers.  Betty the zombie will host a zombie craft talk show.  Sometimes there will be celebrity guests and other zombies who will share their crafting techniques and ideas.  It’s an exciting time for everyone.</p>

<p>Because of this Betty comes to believe that there are no accidents in life or in her case undeath and that the reason she was bitten by the zombie in the first place was to deal with her preexisting issues.  In her twelve-step work there has been much discussion about hitting a bottom, which Betty has come to realize was putting herself in a position to be bitten by a zombie at Target.  Now Betty feels that this has created the important purpose for her of being able to share her experience, strength and hope with other zombies and even the fully alive, through her passion for crafts. </p>
