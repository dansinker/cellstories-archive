<h2>Three Holidays in a Cab</h2>

		</p><p><h4>Halloween Night, sometime late</h4></p><p>A few nights a year stand out: New Year's Eve, 4th of July, St.Patrick's Day, and, more and more, Halloween. Seems that the kiddie candy-gathering aspect of it is eclipsed by the nocturnal masked bacchanale with each passing year. The packs of chaperoned, orderly children hauling pumpkin-hued plastic bags of sweets disappear with the setting sun to be replaced by more or less creatively disguised hordes on the prowl for new ways to forget whatever it is that needs forgetting.</p>

<p>This year, to add to the hijinks, the time-change fell on the same night, adding an extra hour of imbibing to the delight of the reveling masses. No chauffeur of any standing would pass on it. Nevertheless, after a time, the marauding crowds spilling from all directions make for a chaotic and exhausting work environment. We truly earn it on these nights.</p>

<p>There was no shortage of funny get-ups; Forrest Gump giving me chocolates and debating the dubious merits the film that spawned him; two pretty girls dressed as Twiddle Dee and Twiddle Dum; half a dozen mostly mediocre Fred Flintstones; the guy in the very professionally-constructed Whoopee Cushion costume. </p>

<p>She didn't stand out for what she wore but more for her approach... It had to be past the second 2AM, the one that was really 3AM, that I picked her up. She was in a short black dress, fishnets, and very red lipstick and nails. Plopping in the back seat, she immediately asked whether it was OK to smoke, then, if she could sit up front. </p>

<p>This is normally a big no-no--unless there's no room in the back, no one sits in the passenger seat. Besides the possible safety concerns, it implies a familiarity that few drivers would welcome when confronted with the average passenger. These are not our friends, we aren't giving them a lift, no matter how casually we're often addressed, this is still a business transaction. For whatever reason I let that all go.</p>

<p>"Thank you for taking me home", she smiled, a bit bleary-eyed, "So I invited him to a slumber party and he turned me down. I said, <i>Wanna come over for a sleepover, just you and me?</i> and he said no. What's up with that?" </p>

<p>In response to the half-assed comforting cliches I offered, she wasn't impressed: "You don't know me, I'm not that kind of girl. This is the one for me. He's only thirty and a partner in a law firm. He's everything I ever wanted. I'm straight-up small-town. I just wanna be taken care of, you know? He opens doors for me. It makes all the difference."</p>

<p>She'd been at a girlfriend's party texting her dream guy, making arrangements, and when it didn't turn out as she'd hoped, she was in no mood to celebrate any longer. </p>

<p>"Anyways, she's moving to Mexico ON MY BIRTHDAY! So fuck her... So, what about you?" </p>

<p>She refused to believe that her driver had no personal life, but unable to glean any details, she let it go to blow clouds of smoke out the window.</p>

<p>"I can tell you're a decent guy or I wouldn't have sat up front," she said as we slowed at her doorstep. "Will you give me a hug?"</p>

<p>I did.</p>

<p><h4>Christmas</h4></p><p>The trouble with not marking holidays is that the world won't let you forget. The abandoned streets that one's accustomed to at 4AM, are odd, eerie, and lonesome at 4PM on Christmas Day. The few wandering souls that cross paths are the kinds that'd fade into the scenery on a typical day. The absence of others brings them into higher relief, into sharper focus than they warrant or than anyone would ever want them to be in. The unkempt man talking to the brick wall to the side of the shuttered storefront might not catch the eye with a stream of pedestrians ignoring him, but today he's the only show in town.</p>

<p>The few that require transport seem more in their own worlds than on other days. Maybe it's the long pauses between encountering anyone, but these rides feel like intrusions into foreign lands; care must be taken not antagonize the natives or break local customs while backtracking out and onward.</p>

<p>Two teenaged girls preface every direction and request with 'sir,' making one wonder whether it's an ironic game or whether they were raised with some stilted out-of-date formality and this was the one day of the year that they were allowed out among the commoners.</p>

<p>A young, well-dressed Asian woman towing a mountain of gifts hails me in a tony neighborhood. She asks to be taken to a black ghetto area. There's no chatter during the trip and upon arrival she hurries out, shielding her face as if she doesn't want to be seen going where she's going.</p>

<p>Much of the day the rain beats down, making the streets appear even emptier than they do already with the dormant vehicles and unpeopled sidewalks, but toward evening it finally begins to form into flakes, to whiten the city and shrink visibility to but a few hundred feet in any direction. I head out to O'Hare in the hope of catching a stray, weary traveler or two, to maybe find a hot meal as well.</p>

<p>The little restaurant at the Taxi Staging Area is miraculously open, so Christmas dinner's a fairly tough couple skewers of beef kebab over an ocean of rice with a side of wilted lettuce. The option to drown this last in Ranch Dressing proves too tempting to resist. The steam rising from the styrofoam container fogs the car's windows along with the visible breath in the cold, making the surrounding cabs and the airplanes beyond the fence, already being blanketed in snow, fade further and further from view.</p>

<p>After several hours, kept company by a radio rendition of "It's A Wonderful Life", it's time to head to the terminals.</p>

<p>The little round-faced man stomps around, finishing his cigarette, near the head of the line at American Airlines. He crawls in and asks to be taken to Hoffman Estates. I look in the book for directions and an estimate on the fare. In an indeterminate Central European accent, he asks incredulously, "They no allow GPS? I trucker and without this I'm lost." I explain of how little use that system is to a city driver and we shove off westward. </p>

<p>Turning into his cookie-cutter subdivision, I start clicking the Extras button on the meter, explaining that we charge the meter plus one half to go out to the suburbs. This prompts the following bit of Old World wisdom from my passenger, "Rules. Too much fucking rules, this country. I from Europe. I go boating. No drinking, no make noise, go bed 10 o'clock. Why I go out then? Crazy living this country, everyone always chase money. Akhhh, glad be home anyway!" He pays two dollars over the required $53 and bids me farewell.</p>

<p>Back in the city, a woman stands shivering, clutching a white Toy Poodle close while trying to hold on to a bunch of sloppily over-stuffed bags. She thanks me profusely for stopping despite the dog, "Most of you guys won't stop when you see him," she says, though that anyone could feel threatened or put off by the little guy is beyond confounding. </p>

<p>Seems her boyfriend chose to celebrate the birth of Jesus by getting lit and smacking her around. She points to the cop cars clustered down the street, "We were having a good time. All I asked him to do was to stop drinking." </p>

<p>She's headed to her office to spend the night on the couch. "Luckily my business has one." Still in shock, she thanks me profusely and over-tips extravagantly as if to regain some control over a situation that's knocked her on her ass with no warning whatsoever. Driving away, no apology for the human race would suffice to make this thing right.</p>

<p>Many hours later, toward dawn, the woman in the over-sized parka in the middle of the road is the last fare of the night. She asks about my Christmas, tells about eating way too much and getting most of what she'd asked for this year. We pull up to a house and she says to wait while she runs in and grabs her kids before disappearing through the gate, down a gangway and into the dark. Ten minutes later it's time to cut losses. The $10 isn't worth the bother, maybe Santa had one last gift for her after all.</p>

<p>The holidays magnify all that one lacks, forcing one to brood over deficiencies and failures. The best thing is that they end and everyday life resumes, giving the world back the scale and focus necessary to keep getting by. </p>

<p><h4>New Year's Eve</h4></p><p>No one threw up in the cab. In other words, the most fervent wish for the night had come true. An indication of a fairly restrained evening. The hoards went about their celebrating with workmanlike efficiency, collecting fares did not present any special challenge or above-and-beyond type effort, every last one remembering where they lived with a bit of encouragement, no unwelcome advances nor invitations to tussle. All that being said, of course there were many more stalking the streets than the average Thursday, so...</p>

<p>The first fare of the afternoon was a couple just approaching the precipice of their sunset years, who might've been the last two in the U.S. not to have seen the Blue Man Group. He inquired as to what the 'poncho section' referred to on their tickets; unfortunately their driver was of little help, speculating that something might be hurled their way off the stage. "WELL, we'll be changing seats then!" the outraged gent announced, remarking also that he hadn't realized the theater was 'all the way on the North Side'. Out-of-towners that feign familiarity with the local geography are always a rare pleasure, but, as they tipped generously, no more words should be spent smearing their good name.</p>

<p>Gridlock made much of the waning daylight a trial as the whole world seemed intent on getting to where they were going all at once. The passengers did not complain, girding themselves no doubt for the festivities to come. Bartenders and waitresses on their way in exchanged words of encouragement for the slog ahead. We knew that many that crossed our paths tonight would be unaccustomed to being out in public, choosing this one time of the year to grace the world with their presence, and thus would demand a special sort of patience.</p>

<p>Just as boredom was setting in, SHE showed up. Mincing steps on high heels to avoid the slick patches led her to the cab. She introduced herself by name and also, to break the ice, "Not to brag on myself but I just love to love and the way the world is these days, they just take and take and take," she was 35 and on her way to meet a much younger man (this last part confided in a sort of stage whisper). A stop at the liquor store for champagne and then a cigarette lit just as we pulled up to the spot, "Shit, can you go around the block? He doesn't know I smoke and I really need it to get through this." We idled around the corner where she puffed away expounding on Obama, on-line dating, and God-knows-what-else. She was the kind to use your name and make lots of eye contact leaving the impression that techniques were being employed to gain advantage. "I hope you get everything you ever wanted in life," she wished, then crossed the street.</p>

<p>A loud girl with two Middle Eastern guys in tow was next. "Can't believe that bitch threw a drink at you," she shrieked to one of her companions, "What kind of party is it when you can't even have a drink? They were all lesbians, she had like a mohawk and taped-up tits. Bet she'd've been happy if you'd mistaken her for a man..." The guys answered meekly, confessing that they just wanted to get something to eat. It was 11:45PM and they made it to the bar just in time to toast the new year.</p>

<p>Soon the streets filled with marauding packs, arms raised, leaping into the roads in search of transport. Bellowing louder as cabs passed as if their unique call might do the trick where others had failed. Doors locked, zigzagging maneuvers had to be implemented to avoid the enraged gallivanters. Parked outside a pub, many tried the doors, walking away suspiciously when it was explained that the taxi was reserved. A big shot tried to outbid the rest offering $20, then $40 to go mere blocks. He stalked away, incredulous that this tactic didn't produce results, reducing his standing in his date's eyes without a doubt.</p>

<p>Two girls discuss the goings-on, "He was sooo short. He plays tennis professionally, he's like Sicilian. He totally wanted to like make me his wife!", her friend counters, "That guy's not Sicilian, he was adopted, he's from Oklahoma. I saw his I.D. and his name's Michael Jackson...No, really, that's what it said!"...There were many others that blurred together. Some sort of restraint pervaded over the whole night, as if they were all going through the motions, doing all this out of custom rather than any true feeling of elation. Grimly pushing through toward dawn.</p>

<p>Outside a gated condo, a girl runs up followed by a man. "You're my savior! I just wanna go home and sleep. We have to wait for my friend though." With increasing impatience the two watch as another girl fumbles with the intercom, then goes inside the building. "I'd have been fine clearing out their hall closet and sleeping in it. They made us leave because they wanted to fuck and now we have to sit out here and wait for HER!" he bitched. Eventually the wayward one returned and we shoved off. The quarreling died down, replaced by yawns and gentle snores, a night of carousing reducing them all to a trusting child-like state. It was time for bed.</p>

<p>The sky was just beginning to lighten when I opened the mailbox. A letter from the AARP, complete with member's card, awaited my attention. Had this night really lasted a decade? In any case it was time to reset the calendar and start the whole damn thing over again.</p>
