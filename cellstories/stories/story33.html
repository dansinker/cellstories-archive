<h2>The Dog-Gone Dog Is Gone </h2>
	<h3>John M. Flaherty</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>I kissed this girl so good this time, she lost her dog. Literally: lost. We got into each other's business; her dog went missing. I am not being metaphorical; I am not dropping some weird new slang. I am telling you that since this historic trip to first base--to this day--I keep a look out for a missing shaggy white mutt that answers to Snowy.</p>

<p>Two summers ago at four in the morning at I.P. Pavlova in Prague I jumped off a night tram a step ahead of Andrea and Snowy. I turned on cobble stone and caught Andrea, who was jumping into my arms. And there on that cobbled tram stop--in front of a KFC, underneath the tram's electric lines, joined with an audience of cigarette butts, chicken wrappers, a sleeping bum, and two American backpackers who watched and wished they were about to make out with a green-eyed Czech girl--I made out with my green-eyed Czech girl.</p>

<p>It was quite the make out session. Everything you would really expect and want from a four a.m. P.D.A. feel up: tongue sucking, neck biting, hair pulling, nipple pinching--the odd crotch thrust. Andrea and I had been seeing each other for a month, working together for three, and this was our first kiss. It all came out that night. All that tension, all that desire built up over ninety days: flirting in the James Cook Language Center offices, having turkish coffees by Narodni Trida, smoking Pall Mall Blues at Zluta Pumpa, drinking cervene vino at U Sudu. So many translated conversations and explained customs, and what did I have to show for it?</p>

<p>Before that night, I barely had gotten a handshake. Shit, half the times we'd be out, I'd get more action from the dog--Snowy liked to lick my flip-flopped feet under the tables at U Sudu. I know, it was disgusting. And I'm not talking about the toe-licking, I'm talking about allowing dogs--unleashed dogs--into bars and restaurants. But who was I to say? This was The Czech, man. The Wild East. Only, hadn't been too wild for me--not until that night at the tram stop. Andrea and I lost it. We were at each other and we didn't care. Ten, fifteen minutes later when we got up for air, Snowy was gone.</p>

<p>While we were still pressed against each other Andrea called him a few times. “Snowy?” At first, she said his name softly and kind of embarrassedly, like she didn't want the passed out dude or the frat boys eating fried chicken to know she had lost her dog. After a minute of cautious calls and sidelong glances up and down the avenues that ended at I.P., she pushed back from me and began marching along the tram tracks. “Snowy!”</p>

<p>I didn't know what to do. Most of my head was wrapped around plots to get Andrea three blocks back to an apartment I shared with three other English teachers. I looked from side-to-side. I looked up. I looked down. Hell, I even patted down my jeans' pockets, like Snowy--who looked like a canine equivalent of Falcor, the luck dragon, from Neverending Story--was another item, another cell phone, another wallet to be stolen by Gypsy prostitutes who worked the corners in Old Town. I found no Snowy. And as I watched Andrea shout and jog around the perimeter of the tram stop, I knew one thing was as certain as the sunrise that would be coming in two hours: I had to find that fucking dog. If I wanted any future for Andrea and me, it would have to include Snowy.</p>

<p>I booked it to the college kids in front of the KFC. “Hey,” I said. “You seen a dog?”</p>

<p>They looked at me with special sauce smothered around the edges of their mouths. The one wearing a Dodgers cap cocked to the side said, “Sorry, we no sprechen the Czechoslovakian, brosef.”</p>

<p>“A dog,” I said. “Have you seen a dog?” They continued with the blank looks framed by chicken parts. “A white dog? About this big? Shaggy hair?” Nothing still. “Yo, what the fuck? Do you understand English or what?”</p>

<p>“Dude,” said Dodgers, “are you like Canadian or something?”</p>

<p>“What the hell does that have to do with my question? I am looking for a dog. It was with me and the girl when we were on the tram. Did you see it?”</p>

<p>“Man, she's smoking hot,” said our second tourist, a kid probably from Ohio who had a single two-inch beaded braid that flaccidly fell across his forehead. Somebody went to Amsterdam and got high-eye.</p>

<p>“So like,” Dodgers said, “do you live here? Or are you just taking time off from Toronto?”</p>

<p>“I live here and I have never been to Canada. Have you seen the dog?” I saw Andrea at the steps that connected the tram line to the Metro. She waved at me.</p>

<p>“Do you score mad chicks like her on a wicked nonstop basis?”</p>

<p>“Holmes, you got any smokees?”</p>

<p>I ran to Andrea at the Metro entrance. I told her I hadn't seen Snowy and that those two possibly retarded guys had not either.</p>

<p>“Jack, I am fucking fucking out,” she said. This was a bad sign. Andrea, who had been a rock climbing instructor in Melbourne for a year after graduating college, prided herself on her knowledge of dirty Aussie slang. She would never confuse fucking and freaking--even for variety's sake.</p>

<p>“Look, he's fine. I know it. He's a smart guy. Hey, he's a teenager, right? A two-year-old?” Andrea nodded. She breathed deeply through her nose. The green-glassed stud sucked in and out at her nostril. I moved in to wrap my arms around her waist. “Probably hanging out, graffiting up some building--you know: teenagers.”</p>

<p>“Jack.”</p>

<p>“I'll look in the Metro.”</p>

<p>“Somebody could take him.”</p>

<p>“You keep going up and down these side streets.”</p>

<p>“Nice dog. Only dog like him. And these people. Fucking Czech people.”</p>

<p>“Maybe check the park south of the tram stop?”</p>

<p>“South?” She looked at me like I had just hypothesized that someone had caught and cooked Snowy. “What is south? Am I supposed to go down? Into the ground?”</p>

<p>“No, south is that way.” I pointed over her head. “Follow the Number 9 Tram lines. Don't you know directions? In your town? How do you know where you're going?”</p>

<p>“I know where I am. And I need to find my fucking dog.”</p>

<p>She was near tears. I took my hands off her waist and grabbed her hands before kissing the tops of her knuckles. We agreed to check the Metro station together. It was five o'clock and it had just opened. We went down the steps and past the steel stations that looked like they should carry turnstiles to allow single entry but instead held devices to time-stamp tickets you bought from a separate machine. Prague's public transportation was based on the honor system. You technically didn't have to pay to ride. You only paid if you got caught. Without tickets, I led us to the escalator that glided fifty yards down to the Metro platform. It was empty. We saw no people or dogs.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” I said, “he never got off the tram with us?”</p>

<p>“No, I saw him. He was off.”</p>

<p>“You had your eyes open when we were kissing?”</p>

<p>“For fuck's sake, he was off the tram.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he jumped back on.”</p>

<p>The two of us silently took the escalator up to the surface. We spent two more hours looking for Snowy. Partly together, partly together in our cellular connectivity, we trudged around curvy streets, down narrow lanes, through park paths, and across desolate cathedral squares: empty but for pigeons and the last of the devout. That last hour, in daylight, was brutal. After that night, after that kiss, after losing her dog, I just wanted my bed--an air mattress in a lofted bedroom at a shared apartment. Andrea came home with me.</p>

<p>Under my bed at a little table-and-chairs setup, we sat, drank coffee, and smoked a last cigarette. The window cracked open and from the street below I could hear traffic, kids kicking soccer balls, and other dogs barking. Without speaking, we finished smoking then climbed the steps to my bed. We had sex twice. I am certain my three roommates heard. The communist-built walls were thin. We screamed and slapped. We bumped into walls, knocked against the ceiling, rocked creaky loft ply-boards. At some point, the air mattress burst. After, Andrea called whatever number you call when you lose a dog in Prague. She dropped the phone after five minutes and said, “I could hear the woman taking the piss about Snowy's name.”</p>

<p>“It would sound pretty funny to a Chicago dogcatcher if I called looking for snih.”</p>

<p>“Why would it be funny?”</p>

<p>“Sounds like some sort of drug.”</p>

<p>She stayed a little bit longer that morning, but not much longer. Same story for us: we stayed together a little bit longer, but not much. I mean, I understood it immediately. Every time she saw me, she saw a bad memory--the face of her missing dog, her sole companion for the past two years. To her, I might as well have killed the fucker. I needed to find Snowy. And I tried.</p>

<p>I made flyers. Well, technically my students “made” the flyers, but I designed the assignment in class, so same difference. I went to animal shelters--scary joints outside the city where English may as well have been Farsi. I saw a dog that could have been Snowy's older brother. I crouched in front of its cage and assessed: ten pounds heavier and missing three black dots that Snowy had on his pink nose. I could explain the ten pounds. Dog shelters have carb-heavy diets, right? The three dots would require a tattoo artist or--at the very least--a needle, a ball point pen, and some anesthetic. This solution seemed very do-able. If it were anyone else's dog--like my boss's or brother's--I would have done it. Instead, I left the shelter and kept looking.</p>

<p>The second week I spotted Snowy. He was hanging out smoking cigarettes in front of the mall at Flora. I chased him past young hip Europeans with disposable incomes, but lost him when he ran into a tidy McDonald's. The next day I saw him at an IKEA at Zlicin. I was stuck inside the shuttle they used to cart shoppers from the Metro to the store, so all I could do was press my face against the windows and whisper his name while a newly purchased air mattress bumped against my feet. When I saw Andrea at work I reported my sightings.</p>

<p>I said, “He's alive!”</p>

<p>“Who is alive?” Andrea said.</p>

<p>“Snowy.”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“How do you know? You've seen him? Why didn't you tell me? You didn't find him, did you? Seriously, did you find him?”</p>

<p>“No, I do not have him. He is still lost, but I have seen him three times.”</p>

<p>“Where? On the flyers I made?”</p>

<p>“The what?”</p>

<p>“Did you see him by the mall too?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“The IKEA?”</p>

<p>“No, I saw him at Letna and Divorka Sarka.”</p>

<p>“But those are both--aren't those both parks?”</p>

<p>Andrea and I continued to see Snowy from a distance. If I wanted a Pepperoni Pizza Mia from Pizza Hut, Snowy stood out in front busking with a guitar. If I wanted to catch <i>Ocean's Fifteen</i> at the Andel movie theater, Snowy sat four rows up scarfing down popcorn and Mountain Dew. Weekends featured the same deal when Andrea went rafting, cycling or rock climbing. On a Monday in the office she told me Snowy was slow-boating it with a cooler of Pilsner down the Vlatava near Czesky Krumlov. Another time outside Kutna Hora he was rappelling a 100-foot cliff face.</p>

<p>I left Prague at Christmas, just over three months after our kiss. Andrea and I don't keep in touch, though I still have photos of her buried in my hard drive. I don't see Snowy anymore either. Though sometimes—especially when I ride the CTA late at night—I see white blurs when the train speeds past elevated stations. It could be Snowy. Or just a dude decked in white selling <i>Streetwise</i>.</p>
