<h2>The Blotter</h2>
	<h3>John Lendman</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>A year ago, I had a steady stint working as the Metro Editor of my college newspaper in the South Loop of Chicago. We would publish police reports of crimes in our localized blotter section. This was a weekly process. A weekly ordeal. I was usually the one stuck going down to the local police precinct at 7-in-the-morning, to flip through various muggings, stabbings, prostitution stings, robberies and the not-so-occasional “marijuana cigarette” possession. I’d sort through the stack of reports in search of the most violent, horrific assaults or the robberies with the most expensive electronics stolen. Missing teeth, iPhones and laptops were relieving on a deadline. But tonight, I found myself on the other side of the police report. </p>

<p>As local officers asked for my information and jotted down descriptions of my bag, cell phone and watch, I kept thinking this is exactly what it must feel like to be a crime statistic. A crime so frequent, that some Northside publication journalist, or some overly loquacious grad student, probably—hopefully—flipped right past my anti-climatic police report, in search of a more gruesome outcome to print later in the week. </p>

<p>I could only wipe the blood off my forehead and cooperate. </p>

<p>A few hours before, on that Thursday night, I was meeting up with a friend for her birthday dinner in the West Loop, trying to descend into a relaxed, blithely mood. I had worked that morning and had a class in the afternoon. So, having missed the actual dinner, I planned on just showing up for a drink or two. Somehow this predefined minimum turned into three Lakeview bars later. </p>

<p>When I looked down at my watch it was 3 AM and the $2 PBRs were taking their toll. As we left the last bar, we all went in separate directions, me lugging my black messenger bag ahead of a six-block tread. I popped on the ear-pieces from my iPhone and headed east, surprisingly sober. </p>

<p>As I walked east on Belmont, headed to Broadway, I walked past the typical cast of characters: The cluster of mid-transition prostitutes, the trash-hording homeless men, the transient peddlers, the other twenty-something’s stumbling home from the bars in Boystown and infrequently anyone who looked out of place. This is North Halsted at 3 in the morning. </p>

<p>As I came close to Broadway, two black guys in dark baggy clothing—which seemed to be the only description I can remember—started walking towards me. I watched the ground to draw less attention to myself as they noticeably stopped taking when our paths began to cross. As my music played lightly, the taller one stopped and positioned himself in front of me. He wrapped his hands around the nylon strap of my bag and mumbled something to me. I turned down my music, furrowed my brows, tensed my shoulders and pulled the earpieces out. “I’m sorry, what?”  </p>

<p>“TAKE OFF YOUR FUCKING BAG!” </p>

<p>I was confused. My first instinct was to ask, “Why?” but before I could say anything, the taller guy started pulling my bag over my head as his shorter colleague of sorts, pulled back his fist and punched me in the face. </p>

<p>Shit. This is happening. Alright, here take it, I thought, prepared to take more punches. Instead, the shorter one just lifted his oversized layered t-shirt and flashed the gun he had sticking out above the zipper of his jeans or the waistband of his sweatpants—I couldn’t remember. I quickly looked away at the sight of it. </p>

<p>One of them started reaching into my pockets, grabbed my phone and my wallet. I tensed up and put my arms and hands at chest length to avoid seeming uncooperative and thought about the gun in-between us. </p>

<p> It happened so fast, I didn’t even have time to pray. </p>

<p>The one who flashed me his gun somehow managed to thrust me onto the ground, lying on my stomach, with my arms holding up my chest. I was right off the sidewalk outside of a row of duplexes and the stone-façade of a church. He slammed his foot down on my back as I hovered over the damp soil and choppy patches of grass. I was at the foot of an oak tree scraping my arms on the exposed roots. </p>

<p>“I SAID GIVE ME YOUR WATCH, YOUR WATCH!” </p>

<p>Being the one to always talk back at the most inappropriate of times, as well as being a compulsive apologizer, I stammered back, “I’m sorry, I can’t reach it... you’re on my back.” And I really couldn’t. I’ve never had a problem working the clasp of my watch before. As a matter of fact, I took it off frequently to show people its minimalistic charcoal-colored face after being complimented on it. </p>

<p>At that point, I figured I probably wasn’t worth arguing with. And he didn’t seem to have a reason not to shoot me. I clinched my shoulder blades together, still trying to reach for my watch’s clasp. I tightened up and wondered if a shot to my back would be painful or too loud to feel at first. I thought, “God, my mom is going to be so upset, this is so unfair to her.” </p>

<p>I help my breath, clutched my eyes together and waited for the blunt sound and the piercing bullet. I held my breath. </p>

<p>I finally got a grip around the clasp and pushed in the silver hook. He reached down and grabbed the now wide-mouthed strap of my watch and all but ripped it off my wrist. The gunshot never came. Just then he kicked the back of my head as a jump-off point into the curb. Luckily, that’s where it ended. I looked up as the two guys take off towards Halsted with my things. It was unbelievable. My messenger bag carried my digital camera, a recorder I used for interviews, my notebook for class and my jacket, among other possessions. </p>

<p>After getting up, I looked around embarrassed. I was thankful nobody was around to see what I felt was the scene of a coward who just let two degenerates take everything from him. </p>

<p>Walking slowly to Broadway, I wondered how I was going to get in my apartment; my keys were in my bag and my phone with the number to my landlord was taken as well. I just wanted to be in bed. </p>

<p> I walked into the Walgreens around the corner from my apartment, as it was open 24 hours. Walking in, I watched two employees troll around putting various products away, armed with price guns. Nobody was in there shopping, and why would they? By that time, it was 3:30 AM. I stood for 7 minutes by an aisle of two employees debating if I should even ask for help or if I should just ask to use the phone. </p>

<p>“What happened to your forehead!?,” an employee asked. </p>

<p> It took me a while but I finally said, “I was... uh, robbed or mugged, I guess, outside on Belmont; they took my phone and I don’t know what to do...” </p>

<p>I felt so juvenile. The other employee beside him told me to calm down, which pissed me off because I was clearly overly calm, then told me she was going to call the police. I looked down at my shirt, at the dirt, and then at my arms covered in a mix of blood and mud. As one employee went to call the police, the other went to grab a first aid kit. </p>

<p>She handed me a Tupperware container of first aid products and a bottle of water. I reached in and pulled out the first two recognizable things in the box: peroxide and Band-Aids. After I poured peroxide on a handful of paper towels, I washed the dried up dirt from my arms. The blue-polo clad employees left me by the register for photo processing adjacent to a wall of batteries and told me the police were on their way. </p>

<p>I reached in for a couple of Band-Aids and began to peel the white shinny plastic off the adhesive. I couldn’t get a good grip and I couldn’t stop shaking. I kept thinking of all the things the muggers took away from me, wondering where I was going to sleep until I could be let in my building the next morning. </p>

<p> I gripped around the bandage wrappers tightly, closed my eyes and silently cried like I haven’t cried in years. I felt so hopeless, angry and vulnerable. It took me a while to pull myself together before the police came 20 minutes later, only to ask me to go outside again to question me by their squad car. I knew the questions the officer was going to ask me because I’ve read the answers so many times before. </p>

<p>The police officers, having finished taking my information, suggested I stay at a friend’s apartment that had a buzzer to wake him or her up. I immediately thought of my friend Thomas who also lived on my street, then cringed at the thought of having to bother him at 4-in-the-morning. The police walked me up to his place and flashed bright lights at his window as I hit the buzzer until he answered. </p>

<p>After spending the next hour canceling service to my cell phone and credit cards, I thought of how busy the next day of reclaiming what, in essence, had been my whole life back. Still on high alert form the long night, Thomas popped in the third season of 30 Rock until I fell asleep on the nearby bumpy futon. </p>

<p>As days past, I made trips to various downtown offices for my CTA pass, the Thompson Center for a new ID, my bank for new debit cards and an AT&T to repurchase a very expensive cell phone. I decided not to tell anyone other my family back home in Texas and close friends at the risk of having people fuss over me or tell me what they think they would have done in that situation. I didn’t want to hear it. It was bad enough friends started asking me to text them as soon as I got home. </p>

<p>I kept telling myself I was glad I didn’t have a knife or gun on me, knowing it would have likely been used against me. But as I kept replaying the night in my head, all I kept thinking about was how much I wanted to stab, shoot or impale the two guys that got away with screwing me over so much. What’s worse was I felt like there was no lesson learned—I had just become more neurotic than ever walking home alone, and started profiling anyone wearing dark baggy clothes. </p>

<p>The more I thought about what I should have done, the more I realized I wouldn’t have done anything different.</p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>In the next few weeks, after that Thursday night, I picked up every neighborhood publication and read their local blotters and crime statistics. It was a short, but necessary obsession. I never made one of the three to five sentence blurbs—as far as I knew.</p>
