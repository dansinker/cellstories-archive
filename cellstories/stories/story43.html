<h2>Halloween Head</h2>
	<h3>Bobby Biedrzycki</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>So this past Halloween, I witnessed a miracle. It took place in the south loop and like most miracles it happened fast and would’ve been fairly unnoticeable had you not been there to see it. The only tangible evidence I have of this miracle is the story I’m about to tell you and these two pieces of paper right here given to me by The Chicago Police Department.  </p>

<p>I was alone on Halloween night.  A month earlier I’d gone through this really messy break-up with my girlfriend of nearly four years--you guys know the kind of messy break up I’m talking about: the screaming, the crying, then afterwards the drinking, the more drinking. I was so out of it around that time that I had developed this really strange habit of walking up to strangers downtown and quoting Travis Bickle, you know, Robert DeNiro’s character in Taxi Driver.  </p>

<p>I’d walk up to a group of trendy law students who were standing outside on a smoke break and say “Someday a real rain is gonna come and wash all this scum off the streets.”  They’d shrug in confusion. </p>

<p>Like I said, it was one of <i>those</i> kind of break ups. </p>

<p>So there I was alone and costumeless, and I remember feeling so shitty that I didn’t even want to leave the house.  But because it was Halloween I eventually said <i>Fuck It</i> and headed out. </p>

<p>After a few warm-up bars in my neighborhood I showed up at this place Billy’s in the loop around midnight. I was immediately told by one of the employees that my bookie was in the back and he wanted to talk to me. Oh, did I forget to mention I had also been gambling like a madman since the break up. NFL football parlays, five hundred to a thousand dollar swings in either direction on a weekly basis. No bullshit.</p>

<p>My bookie, or at least his “representation” is this big-ass Puerto Rican kid from Humboldt Park named Polo. I know, rumor was his parents were really into Ralph Lauren. Anyway, he was staring at me hard as I approached him and I immediately thought I must have lost big and forgot to pay, maybe I’d called in a bet while I was wasted one night.  </p>

<p>“You little fucker,” he said as I walked up to the booth. “You won the box pool you piece a shit, $2300.” He smiled big and before I knew what was happening I was being handed 2300 bucks. I bought a round of drinks for everyone in the booth, tipped the staff, and headed out the door to the next bar. It wouldn’t have been smart to get drunk in a place where everyone knows you have that kinda money on you. </p>

<p>So about three hours, two bars, and fifteen drinks later I stumble into this shit hole called The South Loop Club. It’s packed as hell and to set the Halloween mood off proper they have an industrial sized smoke machine kicking so hard that I can’t see my feet. I felt like I’d wandered into the fucking Dagobah System.  </p>

<p>Alright so check it, I’m standing there alone in the smoke and I find myself staring at this girl who’s sitting at the bar. She has this huge, gorgeous, mess of black curly hair, and is wearing this killer stonewashed jean jacket with heavy metal patches all over it. Soon the stool next to her opens up and I sit down. She looks at me and I’m instantly in love. She’s biracial, like half black and half Hispanic. And she has these wild, light blue eyes, like a sled dog.  </p>

<p>“What’s up?” She mumbles. </p>

<p>“Umm, Nothing,” I say. Now, I can’t stress to you enough how fucked up I am at this point, but from what I remember it went like this...</p>

<p>We started talking and it felt really comfortable, the conversation began at horror films and we argued about which new remakes sucked and which were better than the originals, then it morphed into music and did I like this band and did she like that group and when was the last time so and so toured and how this bar was pretty weak but Halloween was definitely awesome and then things got deeper and we talked about how even though life could be shitty, it was still pretty cool to be alive, and the more personal our stories got the more I realized I wasn’t the only one fucked up and alone, I wasn’t the only one who had once been addicted to heroin and I was laughing, I mean like really laughing, not some fake ass I-don’t-wanna-cry-so-I’ll-laugh laugh, the kind I had been spewing for the past two months, no, this laugh was real.  </p>

<p>She had this tiny gap between her front teeth and I couldn’t take my eyes off it, and we ordered shots, and then more shots, both drinking coronas to chase them and this was it, this was the kind of night everyone always wrote about, and wished about, and lied about, a stranger in a bar, who appeals to you in every way and you’re lonely and they’re lonely and maybe it’s because of this loneliness that I don’t pay attention to the twitch in my stomach when she says she is only 17 and has snuck into the bar, and I don’t care when she tells me she has hitchhiked to Chicago from Florida but has basically run out of money and when I ask where this money came from, the twenty and change that is in front of her on the bar, she tells me I don’t wanna  know and I don’t, I also don’t wanna know that she is staying at the youth hostel on Congress Avenue, ‘well you know, not really staying there but sleeping there’ cause her bags had all been stolen, and it felt great to ignore all that you guys, and just, just focus on the good, you know, the romance of the whole thing, the way she touched my leg, her finger nails chipped and bitten raw, and how she asked where I lived, the way she tucked her hair behind her ears, the grin, the gap in her teeth, Jesus! that gap, and as the Halloween music blared and the lights at the bar started to go up, before my brain could stop my mouth, or maybe even my soul, my nuero pathways greased with alcohol and loneliness, I asked her to come stay with me in my big, sad apartment in Roger’s Park. We decided, with huge smiles and our first kiss, that we were going to live the rest of our lives together. </p>

<p>And then we were in my car, my shitty 1993 Maxima that used to belong to both me and my ex. But that didn’t matter as this girl, whose name I still didn’t know smiled at me and I drove, wasted, down ninth street toward Michigan Avenue, I know, I know drunk driving is horrible, I KNOW THIS, but we weren’t just heading for the LSD and Rogers Park, we were headed for the rest of our lives. She was kissing my neck, and then my pants were unzipped and her hand was ughh, and I was so fucking in love, and so drunk, so in love with and drunk on something that wasn’t loneliness that I didn’t even see the light turn yellow and then red and I made the left through it anyway onto Michigan and halfway through the intersection the headlights coming from the other direction were upon me, and then smash, and life paused for a second, and we were still. </p>

<p>The air bags had deployed, and she was crying but neither of us were hurt. The other driver had been breaking and I had pulled off to the side just in time so the accident wasn’t nearly as bad as it could’ve been, and I wanted to run. My immediate instinct was to get the fuck outta there. She screamed to let her the fuck out but I slammed my foot on the gas and sped north up Michigan Avenue. About 4 blocks away, at 7th,  was the first time I saw the lights behind me. Bright, cherry red, and shrieking for me to stop. I could deal with that though, because I would, I decided, in a 1993 Nissan Maxima, take these cops once I got to Lake Shore drive. I would, in a 1993 Nissan Maxima, open it up on their asses. This was the logic. The drunken, drunken logic. But when lights appeared in front of me as well, I was forced to stop.  </p>

<p>The cops pointed their weapons and ordered me to get out with my hands up and I did, and then they ordered me to kneel and I did, my pants falling from my hips, exposing my boxers. The girl went straight to one of the cops and started crying again, and as they cuffed me and slammed me face down onto the trunk of the squad I momentarily blacked out. </p>

<p>When I came to I was standing, leaning backwards against the squad, my hands cuffed behind my back, my pants up and buttoned. The girl was nowhere to be seen and the two cops standing in front of me were both big, and they were both black. They asked about insurance information and I directed them to the glove box. One went digging while the other stood in front of me with a small, plain clothed Mexican guy. I soon figured out this was the driver of the van with which I had collided. As I stood there half listening to them tell me things about fleeing the scene of an accident, still feeling the adrenaline from the accident coursing through my veins, I began to sober up. But the clearer my head become the more confused I started to get. The girl was gone, and once he had insurance info and a phone number the Mexican guy was told to leave as well. The two cops then stuck me in the back of the squad while one drove me, and the other my car, to a dark under pass below Michigan near the Metra tracks. They parked, and shut both vehicles’ lights off. </p>

<p>The first question they asked said it all. The lead cop, the guy in the driver side registered me in the rear view mirror, his eyes deep and knowing, like he’d seen more of life than you’d ever want to, and was tired of it. “So,” he started, and lit a cigarette, “you like black girls huh?” </p>

<p>I feigned misunderstanding and he came again, but louder and slower this time, “You like black girls, right?” </p>

<p>“Under age blackgirls,” said the other cop, who was not quite as built as the guy in the driver seat. </p>

<p>I was silent for some time, but I knew I had to answer. “I dunno,” I said, “I mean not really, I mean, I guess I just like girls”  </p>

<p>They both laughed at this, but that quickly stopped.  </p>

<p>“Why do you have 2200 dollars in cash on you partner?” The big cop asked. His tone reminded me this bully who used to fuck with me in fifth grade. </p>

<p>“I won a bet” I told him. </p>

<p>“You don’t have any guns or drugs in the car do you?”  </p>

<p>“No,” I said. </p>

<p>“No offense, tough guy, but we don’t believe you, so we’re gonna check real quick. You sit tight”  </p>

<p>They both got out and I watched from the back of the squad as they searched my ride.  They did it slowly, stopping often for smoke breaks and to talk with other cops who would pull up, but always leave after glancing in my direction. </p>

<p>After an hour or so they came back into the car. </p>

<p>“You weren’t lying,” the big guy said, “that’s good.” Again he looked into the rear view mirror, “Now, you’re car is registered in a woman’s name as well as yours, that you’re girlfriend?” </p>

<p>“Ex.” I told them. </p>

<p>“How would she like it if we were to call her right now, wake her up at 5:30am and tell her that her boyfriend likes to ride around with underage black girls, and run red lights while he’s getting his dick sucked. Not to mention the hit and run.” </p>

<p>They didn’t look back at me, but at the mere image of this phone call I coughed to keep from smiling. “She hates me,” I said. “I’m sure she wouldn’t like to get that phone call, but I can’t say it would really surprise her either.” </p>

<p>They didn’t laugh. I was starting to see what was happening here. The way they kept referring to the girl as “black,” the way they kept telling the other cops to leave, where we were parked. I was about to get my fucking ass kicked.  </p>

<p>They opened up the door, and pulled me out by my arms. I began to get scared. The smaller one went to the trunk of the squad and started digging around while the other guy just stared at me, half smiling, before beginning to take the cuffs off me. This was one of the few times in my life that I can remember actually tasting fear. The cop in back emerged from the trunk with a large roll of duct tape,  </p>

<p>“C’mon,” he said and smiled, motioning to me, my stomach dropped and I felt as if I’d been kicked in the balls, I was going to be tortured, I prepared myself for a beating. “Let’s go fix that air bag for ya” He said. “Tape it back up in the steering column.” </p>

<p>Five minutes later they we’re handing me back all my belongings including the cash. I had already kind of assumed they were gonna keep it, and I woulda been fucking fine with that. “We’re cops” the big guy said, “Not thieves.”  </p>

<p>I must have looked shocked because they commented on my expression (something about a white boy never looking so surprised) and then laughed. They gave me two minor traffic tickets and told me to drive safely. </p>

<p>I was a free man, and I was mystified by it. </p>

<p>I have told this story to a few people and I’m not sure that anyone believes me. In the days that followed, my insurance company asked me to obtain an accident report. I tried on three occasions and was told all three times that a record of no such accident existed. </p>

<p>A close friend of mine who’s a detective fairly high up in the Chicago Police department did some asking around and he could find no record of the accident either. I had two tickets with court dates on them, but if there was no record of the accident why go? I didn’t, and was never contacted further. I was pulled over a few weeks ago and my record came up crystal clear. It was as if the entire incident was erased off the face of the earth. But why? What, if anything, had they planned on doing to me? What stopped them? And most importantly, where did that girl go? </p>

<p>Now I don’t know if what happened to me qualifies as a real true to life miracle, but to quote Jules from Pulp Fiction, It was a freak occurrence. </p>

<p>A miracle.  </p>

<p>A Halloween miracle. </p>
