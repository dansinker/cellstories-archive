<h2>Crush and a Crash</h2>
	<h3>CP Chang </h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>I once had such a mad crush on a woman that I followed her across the ocean from Chicago to Germany. I know it sounds crazy, but you don't understand: Julie was gorgeous. She had long black hair and high cheekbones, long legs that she wasn't afraid of showing off, and a chorus of bluebirds and robins that sang Walt Disney songs whenever she walked by. At least I heard them. Now I know that the romantics in the room want me to tell you how charming she was, how smart she was (she did go to MIT), and how fun she was, but the rest of you understand me when I tell you, she was hot. We worked together for a software company—this was way before the dot-com crash—and we'd spend all day working together and then talking over drinks at happy hour until happy hour became happy-closing-time.  </p>

<p>But, I had problems trying to ask her out. I wasn't good with girls. I had had absolutely no mojo while I was high school and in college. In high school, when I got one girl to go out with me, on the way to pick her up, I got lost, and had to call her from a pay phone for directions to her place. Twice. It was a very short date. I didn't go to prom because I was too shy to ask anyone out after that. And usually just  telling a girl that I liked her got me a response of something like, "Oh…that's…sweet. Um. You see…I'm dying." </p>

<p>"You're dying?!" </p>

<p>"Um. I'm a lesbian." </p>

<p>"What?" </p>

<p>"I'm dying to be a lesbian." And then she'd run off.  </p>

<p>But I was going win Julie over. Julie had gotten a transfer inside the company to this small town in Germany, Worms, which is just south of Frankfurt, and I had bucked for the same transfer, and as it so happens, she needed a roommate. Perfect, right? Sure we spent a lot of time together, but being roommates means she'd realize how awesome I was. Now this was way before that Hugh Jackman and Ashley Judd movie, where the roommates fall in love, you know the one, Someone Like You, but I knew it was just a matter of time before Julie fell for me. I mean c'mon, I was cute, I dressed well, I was good at pool—girls dig that right? And for her birthday, I bought her these gold earrings she had seen at Macy’s—yeah, it was an over-the-top gesture, but I knew that she would like them, and I was trying to do something nice for her. She refused to accept them at first. She said, "CP, I know how expensive these are. I can't take these." But I insisted. She looked good in them. </p>

<p>So I moved into an apartment with Julie, with my bedroom just down the hall from hers.  </p>

<p>But the thing is, you can't just turn it on. Right? You've got to let the magic work its way into her system. And I thought my chance was at Fasching.. Fasching is the German version of Carnivale. Most of the year, the Germans are proper and civilized and like their ordnung, their order. But really, they just bottle up all the craziness and let it out in one big frenzy for Fasching. People think drunk Germans, and you think Octoberfest, right? But imagine, instead of lederhosen, everyone is dressed up in costumes and masks. The girls wear short skirts and low-cut blouses and the guys feel a little more lusty. Masks will do that, you know. It's the one time of the year that Germans go out ready to hook up. This my golden moment, right? You know booze, bodies, masks. I'm not looking for Eyes Wide Shut, mind you, just a midnight kiss.  </p>

<p>She came to the party dressed as a black kitten, and I came as a pirate. But before I get a chance to corner her at the party and confess to her my true love and ask her to be my One and Only, she meets this other guy, Sven. Some tall blonde German truck driver. So he had been a soldier in the German army and probably invaded a few Eastern European countries all by himself. What's so great about him? But I guess Julie liked that rugged look with the boyish smile, whatever. And so she and Sven hooked up.  </p>

<p>And my bedroom was still just down the hallway from hers. Why couldn't they spend time at HIS place? It tore me up to walk past her bedroom and hear the two of them having sex. Every single night, I'd be outside her bedroom door, listening to them go at it—no, not with my ear to the door. Just, outside. Like those housecats and pet dogs who wait outside your bedroom, moping and clawing at the door pathetically. Sure I should have buried my head under my own pillow to drown out the moaning, but if the knife's already in your back, why not twist it?  </p>

<p>That should have been the end of my crush on Julie, but not quite. Because if there's one thing that we've all learned from John Cusack movies, it's that we can win women over with the right words, a boombox, and just the right choice of Peter Gabriel music. In the movies, the nice guy always gets the girl.  </p>

<p>I just had to do the right nice thing for her. And I got another chance one night at a party at our friend Keith’s. Sven, thankfully, couldn't make it to the party. Julie had driven us, because all the cars in Germany were stick shift, and I still couldn't drive stick. Getting there, she had jammed the car into a tough parking spot. We got to the party before remembering that we left a bottle of wine in the car. I figured, I'll be the nice guy and go get it.  </p>

<p>But when I got back to the car, I saw a way better parking spot on the other side of the lot. Now, there was this large yellow sedan parked to the left of her Audi, squeezing us against the curb. Sure, I didn't drive stick, but I'd seen other people drive a stick shift before. How hard could it be? I knew how to drive, I knew how to find reverse, I knew about the foot pedal on the left, the, uh, clutch. Not only would I be a good guy for getting the wine, I'd be a hero for moving the car! </p>

<p>Yeah, it turns out I'm not a born natural. I got the Audi most of the way out of the parking spot, but then I popped the clutch, and there was this bang as the front corner jerked into the car next to me. Now I was in a jam. I was pretty sure that if I tried to get back into first, I'd just ram the front of the Audi into the sedan. So I stayed in reverse, took a deep breath, and rode the car out of the spot. There was this long, loud scrape. Then I was out. I parked the Audi, grabbed the wine, and went back to the party. I told Julie there was a problem with the car, but I played it down. “No big deal,” I said. “Just a slight bump.” </p>

<p>It wasn't until we left Keith's that she saw the car. Her eyes bugged as she said, "You totalled the car!" </p>

<p>"I didn't TOTAL it. The left foglight's busted." </p>

<p>"The headlight is dangling by a wire!"  </p>

<p>"We've got the right headlights."  </p>

<p>"And the hood won't close!" </p>

<p>"It still drives. It's not totaled." </p>

<p>We both knew that we were supposed file a report with the police right then. Everything was covered by insurance. It'd be okay. Well, except that right now, Julie and I were both wasted. If we called the cops to file a report, they would have waited for us to drive away and then pulled us over for drunk driving.  </p>

<p>So instead, we went home. (Yes, we did a lot of drunk driving in those days.) Julie said she would file the report in the morning. </p>

<p>The next day was a work day, and I caught a ride to work from another co-worker. I was still figuring out what nice thing I could do for Julie to make this up to her when she called me at the office, in a panic, "They suspect something." </p>

<p>Julie had parked the car on the side of the street, making sure that the busted up side faced out, and then told the police that someone had hit-and-run her. But then the policeman asked, If someone had hit your car and then took off, where's all the glass?  </p>

<p>I asked Julie, "What did you tell him?" </p>

<p>She was shrill. "What was I supposed to tell him? I said I didn't know!"  </p>

<p>A few nervous days went by. About a week later, Julie got a phone call telling her to show up at the police station. She dragged me along, despite my protests; the cops didn't mention MY name. That may have been the first time that I DIDN'T want to be where Julie was. </p>

<p>We sat in front of the police officer's desk, like two school kids called to the principal's office. The police sergeant didn't ask why I was there, too. He was a gentle-looking man, for being a member of the world's most feared police force. He smiled at us, and he spoke fluent English, like many so Germans do. He said, "We know you did something incorrect." Incorrect. Like a math problem we got wrong. "But we do not know what." That was a good sign. Maybe we'd get off scot free. Then he smiled again, and he said, "We have a charity festival here at the police station. Perhaps you would like to contribute." </p>

<p>Julie began rifling through her purse. I was oblivious. What the hell was he talking about? We're here dodging charges of insurance fraud and this cop is talking about a charity ball? </p>

<p>Julie hissed at me, "How much money do you have?" She was holding a fistful of deutschemarks. I opened up my wallet, and Julie yanked all the cash out of it. I had 80 marks in there—that's like 50 bucks! She threw all the cash on the desk, got up and stormed out of the station. I had to hustle to keep up with her.  </p>

<p>The next couple of days were tense and quiet. Julie wouldn’t talk to me, and I didn’t volunteer much. She gritted her teeth each time we got into the busted-up Audi—the insurance company refused to pay up— and finally, one morning I told her simply, “I’m sorry.”  </p>

<p>She exploded, “What were you thinking? You know you can’t drive stick!” </p>

<p>“I was just trying to do something nice for you.” </p>

<p>“Well, stop! Stop trying to do nice things. It’s not working!” </p>

<p>And she was right. </p>

<p>I started steering clear of Julie and Sven as much as I could. A few weeks later, this woman named Grace came onto the project. Grace was nice, and friendly. Her most distinguishing features were that she was new to the job, new to Germany, and needed a friend. I taught her how to get around town, where to eat, where to shop. She listened to me mope about Julie, had drinks with me, and even taught me how to drive stick. It'd be couple more months before I moved out of Julie's place, (I couldn’t take any more of Sven), but I wound up spending more and more time with Grace. And she seemed to like me, without any heroic gestures on my part, without any Peter Gabriel songs, and I didn't even buy her any gold earrings.</p>
