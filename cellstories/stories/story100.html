<h2>The Apple on Your Head</h2>
	<h3>William Walsh</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>Fanny bites the bruises from your apple and twists the stem to tell you how old you'll be when you die. She says she has a game for later on. But you have to be good. She’s too young to be your mother? But could she be your sister. Is she any blood at all? You know that she's in love with you because she tells you so.</p>

<p>You know you are a boy because you have a thing. You pull it at night unless Fanny wakes you up to watch the naked movies with her. She flips through all the stations to find ones you haven't seen already. The little motor that moves the dish on the roof whirrs and clicks. Fanny keeps the sound down low so as not to disturb Lillian and Mr. Paul. Fanny whispers to you what the people are saying to each other. She can read lips.</p>

<p>One night she tells you that there will be a woman in the future who will try to frighten you into doing certain things. "Don't be afraid," she says. "Listen to her. Do what she says. She'll teach you what I won't be able to."</p>

<p>When Fanny talks like that, you get excited because you think maybe she might tell you who you are, erase your amnesia. But more and more you have the feeling that she doesn't know either, and her talk is only teasing.</p>

<p>Other times she's just bossy. "Hold my hand," she'll say, or "Look at my legs," or "Scratch my back." And when you ask her questions that she doesn't want to answer, she always says, "Wait until you get your curly hairs."
<br> 
<br>You remember the first time you heard the word: Amnesia. You were in the car with Lillian and Mr. Paul on the way to their house from The Home for Little Peoples. They both laughed because you thought their last name was Foster. You sat in between them in the front seat of their stationwagon. Mr. Paul took a hand off the steering wheel and asked you to pull his finger, then he farted. Lillian pinched your nose and rolled down her window.</p>

<p>Last week, when Lillian and Mr. Paul were both out of the house, Fanny decided it was time again to re-tip her arrows. The money she spends on new tips. If she would only stop aiming at things that arrows don't go into, like big rocks.
<br> 
<br>           She says she used to have guns when she was younger. That's how she ruined her ears. Arrows are quieter than guns, but not silent.</p>

<p>You polish her crossbow and wax the new arrow tips for her, hoping she will put off your lessons for a while longer. The folders the school sends are getting fatter and fatter. Everything in the files seems familiar, but that may only be because you know you learned it all before.</p>

<p>You can make Fanny forget about the lessons if your dreams are good enough. She likes the ones about empty boxes inside of empty boxes, and the ones about big rooms and stick figure people with long hair hiding their faces. But they have to be true dreams. She can tell when you’re making them up.</p>

<p>There is one dream that Fanny is in, but you haven't told her yet. You are the same size as her and you are in a clearing in the woods. You stand behind her and watch her shoot an arrow at an apple on the head of a stick figure boy. You know that the stick figure boy is you. And you know that the apple on your head might not be an apple. But you think it's an apple, and the look in Fanny’s eye says it's an apple.</p>

<p>Fanny hits the apple dead center. When you wake up, you are holding your breath.
<br> 
<br>Mr. Paul is tired all the time and when he isn't he pretends to be. When he comes home from work at the end of the day he wants a quiet house. He eats his supper in the livingroom watching the news on TV. After supper, he drinks beer until he dozes off.</p>

<p>Lillian works on her puzzles in the basement once she's finished with the dishes. She has a lighted magnifying glass that she looks through. She only comes upstairs if Fanny and Mr. Paul argue about what to watch on TV. They fight over the remote control, and Lillian has to get between them.</p>

<p>Sometimes when you're in the woods alone, Fanny will take off her shirt. She calls her boobs bug bites. She says they'll be bigger when she's older, but she won't say how old she is. Some of her homeschool files say tenth grade and others say eighth. She’s tall, but she has a baby girl face.
<br> 
<br>Lillian takes you with her when she goes food shopping. She always forgets to bring her list and has trouble remembering what she needs. She lets you push the cart and she buys what you like. Except for apples. You don't ask Lillian for apples. Fanny gets the apples. As Lillian puts things into the cart, she adds them up in her head. Her total is always exactly the same as what the lady at the cash register gets.</p>

<p>If she could, Fanny says she would eat you whole and give birth to you in nine months or nine years, however long it would take.</p>

<p>After two weeks Lillian stops making your scrapbook because there weren't any more stories about you in the Ampersand Mirror. The last two stories don’t even have your picture. Lillian wonders if the stories about you haven't stopped in newspapers in other states. But she says that pretty soon there will be a milk carton with you on it.
<br> 
<br>When you finish the apple, you take off your shirt. Fanny takes her shirt off too. She brings an apple out from behind her back. You put the apple on your head. She turns and counts out twenty-five paces heal to toe. She raises her crossbow, aims at the apple on your head with one eye closed and lets the arrow fly.</p>

<p>            The arrow hits the apple dead center. You stop holding your breath.</p>

<p>            Fanny looks at you closely. She can't see that you have changed. You have memories now. You have a mother. You remember taking a bath in the kitchen sink and the lights went out. You sat in the sink in the dark, and the water got cold, and you could hear that your mother was crying in another room.</p>

<p>            The apple stays on the tree, pierced by the arrow. Fanny puts on her shirt.</p>

<p>            "We'll play this game again, she says, "Every day until you remember. Or until I miss the apple."
<br>          
<br>  Miss the apple. Miss you. Miss everything.</p>
