<h2>The Night Sam Cooke Saved My Relationship with Marina Ojeda</h2>
	<h3>Michael Zapata</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>When Marina was mad at me her eyes were like <i>aquardiente, </i>or like the eyes of that android in the Sarah Connor Chronicles, but I don’t want to overstate it or kill what I’m trying to say with pop references. I don’t want to do that. I want – what I’m trying to explain is that her eyes most days were beautiful, empyrean and full of <i>luz…</i>but when she was mad, her eyes were like <i>aquaridente,</i> which makes the most sense to me right now. We talk enough about women’s eyes but, she, Marina Ojeda, had eyes like that. </p>

<p>One night, at a restaurant, I think, called Paz, somewhere off of Division, I had said or done something and it hadn’t been what I’d said or done necessarily, but it had been an addendum to other things, careless, inconsiderate things – things that had grown like an appendage on an embryo. The waitress, a tall and spindly woman, came over to see if everything was alright. Marina had, or I had, I don’t remember, slammed a near-full glass down on the table and the juice, I remember it was <i>jugo de mana,</i> pulpy and florid, spilled on the table. Anyway, Marina said we were sorry and she was sorry and she gave the waitress a generous tip and hugged her. I’d never seen someone actually hug a waitress before. After Marina stormed off, I’m sure I thought our relationship was over. </p>

<p>Later that night Marina came over and although her eyes had softened, she was still angry and I felt terrible and incompetent, a satire of a younger version of myself, a Don Quixote. But I listened to her injuries and I agreed with her and knowing that I needed more (more than myself, I thought sadly at the time) I brought out a bottle of wine and put on Sam Cooke. The song Sentimental Reasons played and then Tenderness, which is basically a list of the things I should’ve done in my relationship with Marina. But it’s a good song and there’s a sweet and short and sympathetic piano that accompanies Sam Cooke’s voice, which carries multitudes of loneliness and warning. So, in Tenderness, Sam Cooke is really singing some sense.</p>

<p>She cried a little and smiled – a soft and sure lunette – and then slipped her hand into the crook of my arm. I told her that I was sorry and I meant it and we danced for some time in my apartment, which was on the 10th floor of a complex and faced the Lake and, that night, we could see the <i>luna</i> and the firmament of the eastern horizon, which was torpid and indigo, and that meant clouds were forming and a light summer rain would follow.</p>

<p>And this is how it was for two more weeks – almost all we listened to at night was Sam Cooke – until she told me without anger or guilt, her eyes just beautiful, just empyrean and full of <i>luz,</i> that she was moving back to Mexico City. She did go, at the end of that summer, and the next time I saw her was nearly twelve years later at a market on Chicago and Rockwell, and she was with a little girl, her daughter, who had the same lunette smile, and Marina hugged me we talked about how to pick out the best avocados, something I still don’t understand. I never saw Marina again and just before my father passed away last year he told me to marry the first woman I met who was nice, really nice, to waitresses because it says more than anything else you could ever find out about a person, it really does, he said, like it was a hard won secret, like I’d be an idiot not to listen.</p>
