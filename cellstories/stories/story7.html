<h2>Sea World</h2>
	<h3>Matthew Miller </h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>In the summer of 1998, I worked as trainer in “The Wild Wings Bird Show!” at Sea World Cleveland.  It was a rainy, humid summer in Ohio, the summer of ’98. It was the summer of <i>Saving Private Ryan</i> and <i>Armageddon</i>. The summer of <i>I get knocked down, but I get up again you know you’re never gonna keep me down</i> and <i>I don’t wanna close my eyes cause I don’t wanna fall asleep cause I miss ya baby</i> and <i>I don’t wanna miss a thing</i> and definitely <i>gettin’ jiggy wit it na na na nah na nah</i>. It was the summer Phil Hartman was murdered by his wife. It was the summer I broke my ankle. And the summer I learned about cancer. But mostly, it was the summer I spent with the birds. </p>

<p>As far as northeast Ohio was concerned, Sea World was one of the best summer jobs around: decent money, lots of hot girls, and cool animals. Top five random Sea World facts: </p>

<p>Fact #1: Most people don’t know that Sea World Cleveland was actually the very first of the Sea World theme parks and it makes a lot of sense as it’s very difficult to go whale watching in northeast Ohio otherwise.</p>

<p>Fact #2: The vast majorities of the animals at Sea World were born in captivity or were seriously injured in the wild and rescued. </p>

<p>Fact #3: Sea World doesn’t sell pretzels until after 4PM. The reason being that once you’ve had a pretzel, you’re generally pretty full and don’t feel like buying more over priced food. </p>

<p>Fact #4: You can’t get drinking straws at Sea World because the water birds eat them and die. </p>

<p>Fact #5 (and this is a good one): When the dolphins are in heat, the trainers close the observation pool as the dolphins sometimes derive sexual pleasure from throwing themselves against the walls of the pool, and, on occasion, they have been known to accidentally fly out and hit people. And nothing will ruin your day faster at Sea World than being smacked in the face by a horny porpoise. 
<br>Like all theme parks, Sea World was essentially a small city with a very structured departmental government. With nearly 20 different departments from Food Service to Animal Care, the park administration saw fit to give each department its own color of standard issue three button work shirt so any employee could be immediately identified with their department. For example, the color for the Entertainment Department was black. Horticulture was navy blue and Accounting, a garish pink. As a result, to gaze upon the employee lunch room at virtually any time of day was to behold a living Jackson Pollock painting: green shirts mingling with red shirts, a trio of black shirts in the corner, a mass of orange shirts lounging against the wall. An ever-morphing human kaleidoscope. </p>

<p>Now with department affiliation also came social status. Not all departments were created equal. At the bottom of the pyramid was the Operations department or Ops as it was known. Light blue work shirt. Ops employees walked around the park with a broom and a waste can. They cleaned up barf. They were social pariahs.  </p>

<p>Skipping up a couple rungs past the Merchandise and Ticketing departments, there was Food Service, the bourgeoisie of Sea World Departments. Dark red workshirt. For two summers during high school I learned about the snack proclivities of Mr. & Mrs. Middle Class America as an assistant manager for the Shamu Land Area.  </p>

<p>As a quick aside, it was also during those two summers that I was briefly knocked unconscious by a low flying duck. I had thought the duck was flying abnormally low, but a lot of ducks fly low at Sea World. I can tell you that it is well nigh impossible to look cool after one has just been leveled by a mallard and if I ever see that duck again, I will fucking kill it.  </p>

<p>After Food Service, you have the Horticulture department, dark blue workshirt, which is populated by senior citizens and insanely hot college girls. The real Hugh Heffner’s of Sea World, however, were the water skiers. Toothsome and bronzed, they appeared to have been assembled by seventh grade boys. To be invited to one of the water skier’s exclusive house parties was a badge you could wear the entire summer. </p>

<p>Near the very top of the social pyramid, without a doubt, were the animal trainers. Every freckle-faced fifteen year-old working the Captain Kidd Stuffed Animal Treasure Chest dreamed of one day shucking their light green work shirt for the cream-colored v-neck tee of the Animal Care Department. And really, the trainers were all very intelligent and nice people, but generally more comfortable communing with the dolphins or seals than other humans.  </p>

<p>Ultimately, at the pinnacle of social prestige were the park emcees. The emcees were park celebrities. Sea World Cleveland employed six or seven emcees that rotated through all of the shows from the “Baywatch Water-ski Adventure Show!” to the “Hawaiian High Dive Luau!” Most emcees gained a reputation for being better at one show than others. For instance, Linda was great in the high dive show and barely competent at the “Hotel Clyde and Seamore!” which required a fair amount of improvisation. Brian was pretty solid in the bird show, but never really got the requisite melodramatic flair required for the “Shamu Spectacular!” Danny, however, Danny was the best at all of them.  </p>

<p>Tall and tan with an exceptional wit, Danny was a great performer. In a previous life he had probably been an elf. Everything worked when Danny was in the bird show: the corny bird jokes, the transitions, the false sense of patriotism when the bald eagle was introduced at the end of the show. Danny made it beautiful. </p>

<p>But I wasn’t an emcee. I was a trainer, and, as fate would have it, I was a <i>bird</i> trainer—a job that requires you to love birds, and furthermore, to help other people love birds. The irony was not lost on me. And while I was proud of my cream-colored v-neck tee, what the Vice President of Entertainment at Sea World doesn’t tell you when you interview to be a trainer at the bird show is that 10% of the job is doing the show and the other 90% of the job is cutting up rat meat and cleaning up bird shit.  </p>

<p>Every morning, the first job of the day was to prepare the birds’ food—and for birds of prey that means rats. Sea World ordered their rats from a place called the Gourmet Rodent. The rats are shipped frozen and are guaranteed to be disease free. Every night the last trainer out of the shabby trailer where we kept both the birds and the supplies put fifty rats in a Rubbermaid tray to thaw in the fridge overnight. In the morning, two trainers prepared the rats—and by “prepared” I mean cut them up with a pair of scissors. To prepare a rat, you first cut off the rat’s head. Then the feet. Then the tail. Cutting up the belly of the rat you then pull off the hide and remove the abdominal wall and gastrointestinal track. The birds, like pro athletes, only got the best cuts of meat.  </p>

<p>My hands smelled of death for that entire summer. No soap could entirely remove the smell of dead rat. The cool trainers didn’t even wear gloves. However, one of the other trainers and I did perfect a method of skinning the rats so as to keep the hide more or less intact while removing the guts effectively making a cute little rat puppet. We took to making three or four rat puppets every morning and then staging scenes from big musicals for the rest of the crew. We even made little costumes. We did the marionette scene from <i>The Sound of Music</i> and “I Got No Strings’ from <i>Pinocchio</i>. It was all very sick and very wrong. </p>

<p>But the show, doing the show was definitely fun. “The Wild Wings Bird Show!” took place in a large circular stadium surrounded by soaring maple and fir trees. The stage was a bright green circle of astro-turf with various poles and fake trees dotting the perimeter. The show was hosted by an emcee and two trainers—one for the birds of prey and one for the exotic birds—and a handful of other trainers hid throughout the stadium to catch and release birds at various points during the show. Essentially the emcee would start the show with a welcome and some lame bird jokes, introduce the two on-stage trainers, and then banter with them as they presented their respective flying critters. As hokey as the show was, the birds were pretty amazing in action and audiences always lingered in the stands for a chance to see the hawks and owls and condors close up in the meet n’ greet after the show. </p>

<p>My favorite part of the show was introducing the birds. Birds of prey are not the brightest of animals and as such do not respond to their names. By the beginning of June, I began to experiment with re-naming the birds for each and every show, much to the chagrin of the emcee who then had to use that name for the rest of the segment. I started conservatively at first: “Ladies and gentlemen, this is our bald eagle, Hilary Clinton.” </p>

<p>And then I got bolder.  </p>

<p>“Now entering the stadium, our Harris hawks, natives of the desert southwest, Spamhead and Chunkers!” 
<br>And bolder. </p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, now entering the arena on silent and deadly wings, our Eurasian eagle owl, Roast Beef!”</p>

<p>This was generally a showstopper. People would laugh or look confused (Is that bird really named Roast Beef?) and generally the emcee would break or pointedly ask me for the bird’s real name. But not Danny. Without missing a beat, Danny would look me in the eye and say, “Tell me about Spamhead and Chunkers, Matt, is it true that they hunt in packs?” </p>

<p>Danny was the best. </p>

<p>A couple weeks into June, Danny called a meeting and told all the trainers in an uncharacteristic low monotone that he had liver cancer and that it was terminal and that the doctors had given him three months to live. The pain was pretty severe sometimes and the narcotics he was on didn’t really help. The only thing that really took away the pain was marijuana. A couple puffs, according to Danny, were more effective than two doses of vicodin. Patrick, the hippie stage manager assigned to the bird show, took it upon himself to make sure that Danny always had a steady supply of good weed for the rest of the summer. </p>

<p>In the beginning of July, our red tailed hawk Timagen, distracted by a sparrow during a training session abandoned his routine and flew into the park. In the ensuing Benny Hill chase sequence, I fractured my ankle jumping over a fence. Since I could no longer perform the show, Teri, the head trainer, assigned me to narrator duty at an exhibit called Bald Eagle Point. For the next month and a half I sat on a stool and answered questions about bald eagles: </p>

<p><i>Mister, is it true that bald eagles have sex in the air?</i></p>

<p>No, that’s actually a courtship behavior. Fertilization takes place on the ground and is known as a cloacal kiss. </p>

<p>Mister, did that eagle break your leg?</p>

<p>No, but eagles are very strong. One of the eagles fractured a trainer’s arm last summer by just squeezing its talons a bit too hard. </p>

<p>Mister, what do eagles eat?</p>

<p>Children. Mostly children. </p>

<p>Despite the spazzy kids and gabby tourists, being with the eagles was really peaceful—especially in the mornings, when the park was quiet and the birds would cluck softly to one another and stretch their broken wings in the sun. Sea World had six mature bald eagles that had all been seriously injured in the wild. Some had been shot by hunters.  A couple had been hit by cars while scavenging road kill. One had been injured in a storm. They were beautiful animals, fierce and proud, and for a brief time we were together in our brokenness.</p>

<p>At about the same time I broke my ankle, Danny took a leave of absence from Sea World. He intended to do some traveling with his partner, to see some more of the world before he died, but the cancer was moving too quickly and he wasn’t strong enough to travel very far. So instead he and his partner rented a bright red VW convertible for the rest of the summer.  He called the trailer once in awhile and told us about the soap operas he was now addicted to. At the end of July, he rented a big carnival tent and threw himself a going away party, a living funeral, although he had to lie on a couch for much of it. </p>

<p>In mid-August, Teri told us that Danny was coming back for one last day of shows. That he wanted to do his job one last time before he died. We hadn’t seen Danny in several weeks, and when he strode up to the trailer he was impossibly thin. He wore a wan smile, his complexion was jaundiced, and a cowboy hat covered his hair now brittle and thinning. But the man was undaunted. </p>

<p>There were only two bird shows scheduled that particular Wednesday. Attendance was usually down mid-week. The other trainers all agreed that that was a good thing as Danny probably couldn’t handle more than two twenty-five minute shows. At our morning meeting, Teri, who knew Danny the longest, informed the rest of the trainers that she would be performing both shows that day. No one objected.  </p>

<p>The first show went well. Nothing unusual. The birds did what they were supposed to do, and the audience oooh-ed and ahhh-ed in all the right places.  </p>

<p>When the gate to the stadium opened for the last show of Danny’s life, the usual sea of tourists in tacky air-brushed shirts with their camera bags and strollers and screaming babies was missing. Instead, I watched from my post backstage as a cluster of navy blue shirts entered the stadium followed by a group of black shirts and then a handful of green shirts and then orange and yellow and maroon and white. Everyone had come to say goodbye to Danny.  Everyone had come to see Danny do the show one last time. 
<br>After the show, after all the tears and hugs and laughs, I bumped into Danny and his partner on the way back to their convertible and we walked together for a moment.</p>

<p>Then Danny, the consummate performer, asked me “Was it a good show?” </p>

<p>“It was a good show.” I said. 
<br>“Good,” he said, “I was afraid it was a little slow.” </p>

<p>“No,” I said, “it was a good show, Danny.” And I wanted to tell him then how much I admired him. How his bravery, his love for life in the face of such terrible adversity would always be with me. How I hoped to conduct myself in times of trial with his same grace and aplomb. </p>

<p>But all I could say was “I’ll see ya around, Danny.” </p>

<p>“Yeah,” he said with a half smile, “see ya.”  </p>

<p>Danny died a couple weeks later. </p>

<p>At the end of the summer, the park closes to the public. All the food stands are winterized. Tarps are draped over the flower beds. The muzak that courses through the thousands of hidden speakers is finally turned off.  And at the bird show, all the birds are treated to several days of huge meals. A direct result of this feasting is a massive molt. The birds, instinctually sensing that they have enough calories to grow new feathers, drop their old ones, rendering themselves flightless for days. They do this because the future is uncertain and when fortune affords you a good meal and a warm perch you take advantage of the opportunity. They do this because Mother Nature, as any bird will tell you, makes no promises. </p>
