<h2>A Brief Moment of Terror at MLK Junior High School</h2>

		</p><p>Miss Marble is in a slight panic. After the last bell rings, she notices that Buddy, the lanky black boy with awkward limbs and rheumy eyes, does not rush to the back of the room to grab his worn-looking backpack. The boy does not stand the way he usually does, slow, glaring, his shoulders peaked like an unspoken threat, to go put on his enormous jacket. He only sits there at this desk, the desk which is too small for a boy his size, a boy that should have finished sixth grade at the end of last year, or so Miss Marble has been told a number of times, both by her principal Mrs. Warner and the other teachers who all sit around the faculty room smoking through their tears. Buddy has been a problem all year even though it is only October and the school year has just been a little more than two months or so. Miss Marble, Ellen, as is her given name, suddenly pretends to be busy. She decides to clean off the chalk board, hoping the boy will just make himself disappear. <i>Please just leave. Please just leave,</i> Miss Marble thinks to herself, then feels guilty for thinking such a thought, then looks up at Buddy, and his unreadable, unfamiliar expression, at which points she feels panicked all over again. <i>Please just leave. Please just leave.</i></p>

<p>              When Miss Marble turns, facing the blackboard, she can feel the boy’s stern eyes moving up and down her spine. She can feel his glance boring into the back of her neck. She quickly glimpses over her shoulder and sees he is still just sitting there, staring up at her without any expression at all, his mouth slightly agape, his hands gripping the desktop the way they usually do, as if at any moment, he might just let go, collapsing onto the floor in a tangle of odd angles and loose-fitting clothes. Miss Marble begins to get more than a little worried now. Although Buddy can be likable sometimes, usually during art class where he likes to be left alone, he generally prefers to express himself through violence. He will flick the ears of the girls who sit in front of him. He will slap the boys who are smaller than him on the back of their necks. He will curl his fingers into the shape of a pistol and take aim on the rest of the students in the class, telling them, “Bang. You dead.” When he gets in trouble for doing that, he will spend en entire afternoon drawing an incredibly realistic-looking sketch of a 9 millimeter—so detailed that Miss Marble has a feeling that the boy may actually own one or two of his own—and threaten his classmates with the drawing instead. He will hold up the piece of lined notebook paper and point the graphite weapon at the students nearest him and whisper, “Bang. Bang. You all dead. You all dead.” At moments like that, Miss Marble will regret her decision to join Teachers For America. She will regret not going directly onto law school as she had originally planned. She will regret not quitting that very first day of the school year, which was the very first day she knew she would not be able to handle it, as she is only twenty-two, a white girl who grew up in the suburbs, with red hair and very fine features, now teaching on the south side, at an all black school. Miss Marble knows she will not make it to the end of the year, which is more than seven months off, and more than she knows she can do.</p>

<p>              Miss Marble finishes cleaning off the blackboard, swiping at the chalk with a belabored urgency, feeling more and more desperate as the other children leave, the classroom now becoming completely empty. She sets down the eraser, pretends to check her lesson plans, glances up, sees the boy is still staring at her, then quickly glances down again. Is he smiling? Or is it a frown? Is he leering? Is he staring at her right now with something like criminal intent? Miss Marble does not know. At her school, Miss Marble is often stared at like a ghost. The eighth grade boys, tall in basketball jerseys with full grown mustaches, pricey watches, and gold chains about their necks, sometimes whistle at her in the hallway. She ignores them, which does not help actually. Every day, like her students, she sits in the classroom completely mollified, hopelessly watching the clock, wondering why she is doing what she is now doing.</p>

<p>              Buddy stands finally and walks up towards the front of the class. Miss Marble almost lets out a nervous shout, stifling it with a cough when she sees him approach. She can see that Buddy has grabbed his black book bag and is now carrying it towards her. Seeing the book bag in the boy’s hand, Miss Marble immediately begins to imagine the uninspired headlines of her own death. As Buddy comes closer, she notices the small, shaven spiral along his low hairline. It is a haircut he has been teased about throughout the year. It makes him look younger somehow, not older. Buddy, glaring at her now, suddenly reaches down into his bag. Miss Marble’s heart becomes a vise, and not just a vise, but a rusty, worn-out vise which has seized upon its own treads. She is no longer breathing. What the boy pulls out then is a not handgun, is not a weapon, but a shiny silver Halloween mask. It is entirely silver, nearly featureless, with holes for the eyes and the nostrils, and thin silvery lips.</p>

<p>              “I brought this,” Buddy says, placing it on the edge of her desk.</p>

<p>              “What is it?” Miss Marble asks, still frightened, still a little desperate.</p>

<p>              “The Silver Surfer. He fights the Fantastic Four. He used to be bad but now he’s good.”</p>

<p>              “He’s a superhero?” she asks.</p>

<p>              “Naw,” Buddy says. “Kind of. He flies through space on his surfboard. He fights space monsters. He’s tough.”</p>

<p>              “Well, thank you, Buddy.”</p>

<p>              Buddy nods, as if he is unsure now of why he has done what he has done, and so he stops by the doorway. “Silver Surfer is my favorite comic book in the world,” the boy says. “We were talking about favorite books yesterday, so. Well, that’s all I’m saying.”</p>

<p>              “Okay. Thanks, Buddy,” Miss Marble says. “See you tomorrow.”
<br> 
<br>             The boy turns and exits. Miss Marble sighs, her heart still beating hard. She turns to look out the doorway to be sure she is alone, then she tries on the mask. She sits behind the wooden desk, staring from behind the small, thin piece of plastic, and for once, for once, she does not feel like dying.</p>
