<h2>Carrie</h2>
	<h3>Matt Miller</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>I met Carrie two years ago; she was a student in a beginning acting class I was teaching on Saturday mornings for a college downtown. It was a small class, ten students or so and Carrie’s arrival was always noticeable for a couple reasons. First, Carrie was a stunningly beautiful woman--Halle Berry beautiful--probably thirty one or thirty two years-old with caramel skin, curly brown hair, a slim figure with impossible curves and all of it accented by a devilish smile that made all the men in the class, me included, a little weak in the knees.  </p>

<p>In addition to her head turning good looks, Carrie was habitually ten minutes late to class, generally creeping in during the first scene presentation, always looking tired, like she hadn’t slept well or at all, in fact. Despite her tardiness, she was always extremely well prepared for class and active in the discussions. Carrie told the class on the first day that she was a nurse at a hospital out in the suburbs and I always assumed her lateness was connected to her work, that she probably worked the overnight shift at the hospital on Fridays. And to a certain degree I was right. </p>

<p>Fast forward through the next six weeks. The students have all progressed nicely and it has been a good group. After the last class, some of the students invite me out for a drink at the bar across the street from the office building we met in. We had a couple beers and some mozzarella sticks, and we talked about acting and plays and sports for a good while. At around 4:00, the group began to split it up. We walked out of the bar, each person waving and walking off in the brisk spring air with promises to stay in touch. Except for Carrie, who lingered in the doorway.  </p>

<p>“What are you doing tonight?” she asked. </p>

<p> “Nothing,” I said.  </p>

<p>“Do you want to go see a movie?” and she recommended a couple she was interested in seeing. A hopeful smile lingered on her face. </p>

<p>“OK.”  I said.  </p>

<p>And we were off. </p>

<p>On the way to the movie theatre, Carrie was all smiles and bubbly chitchat. And in the seat next to her I was only half listening because the other half of me was desperately trying to figure out if we were on a date. In all the time of the six week acting class, it had never once occurred to me that she would be someone I could have a romantic connection with. Why? Because super hot girls like Carrie don’t date guys like me—unless we’re loaded. And I am definitely not loaded. The fact was, we were just in completely separate leagues just in terms of looks, and, not to be overly critical of myself, but it was like I was playing single A baseball out in Peoria just trying to make the team and she was the all-star center fielder for the Cubs. That’s what I was thinking. It just can’t be true. It just can’t work.  </p>

<p>But, she did ask me out, right? Oh god please let this be a date! As all of my friends will tell you, I am super picky when it comes to women and dating. I have impossibly high standards and as a result I seem to have a never-ending string of one or two date relationships. But Carrie, well, everything about Carrie just seemed great. </p>

<p>So: we go to see a movie called Brick, a slick film noir set in a California high school that Carrie had already seen, but had really enjoyed and wanted me to see as well. As the movie wore on, our hands met in the dark.</p>

<p>After the movie, on the way back to her car, we kissed in the elevator of the parking garage. </p>

<p>At this point it’s very clear to me that I am now the leading character in my own private Aerosmith video. You know the ones with Alicia Silverstone and Liv Tyler. And in my video the super hot girl asks out her teacher—after the course is over I might add, which was really sweet of her and also eliminated any ethical obstacles that I certainly would have had otherwise—AND she’s smart—her undergrad major was Chemistry--AND she’s a nurse. It’s love in an elevator, baby. Lovin’ it up, till I hit the ground. </p>

<p>On our next date we went to see a play together and got a nice dinner afterwards. Being out with her was amazing. She held my hand the whole time we were together. We kissed frequently. I noticed both men and women in the restaurant checking her out as she walked to our table and it was secretly thrilling. </p>

<p>On our third date, Carrie was different from the moment I picked her up. She was quiet, her thousand watt smile was subdued, clearly something was on her mind. We got to the restaurant and as soon as we’d ordered she looked me dead in the eye and said in a hushed, measured voice, “I have to tell you something.”  
<br>This is the sentence all new boyfriends fear. My mind began running frantically down the list of possible secrets she was about to reveal to me.</p>

<p>She was married. She had an STD. She had a penis. She was a Yankees fan. </p>

<p>But instead, she says this: “I’m not a nurse. I lied.” A long pause. “I’m a dancer.” </p>

<p> “Oh cool,” I said, “like a ballerina dancer? Like with the Joffrey or Hubbard Street? That’s great. I like dancers.” </p>

<p>“No”, Carrie said, “like an exotic dancer. A topless dancer.”  </p>

<p>“Oh wow,” I said, “that’s cool.” </p>

<p>I actually said that. “That’s cool,” I said. And the pretty amazing PG-13 Aerosmith video I had been living in suddenly earned an R rating.</p>

<p>And in that moment of blessed disclosure, the fact that I never did well with girls in high school and the fact that I didn’t have sex during college, and am always the good guy who finishes last, all of that fades away, because suddenly, I am living the unspoken, unconscious dream of slightly balding young men everywhere—don’t deny it my balding brothers, even though you might not be able to admit it in present company doesn’t make it any less true. The god of under-sexed men everywhere has smiled upon me and for reasons not entirely known to me, I am dating a stripper. </p>

<p>But to be fair, in that same moment I am also having this reaction. “Oh god, I’m dating a stripper???” It was a smaller, quieter voice in my head, but it was there from the beginning nonetheless. </p>

<p>Over dinner I got the whole story--and her reasoning. She’d been dancing for almost four years and she had worked at the most exclusive club in the city for most of that time. She only worked three or four days a week and in a good year her income broke six figures. Six figures. In her ample free time she took classes, studying whatever she might be curious about.  </p>

<p>She was good at this speech, clearly she had delivered it before, and by the end of it I saw her point. According to her, god had given her some natural attributes that were well, very impressive. According to her the world was a patently unfair phallo-centric place and since she was smart enough to recognize that, she had no compunction about taking advantage of the system and playing the cards she had been dealt. It was suspect logic to be sure, but in the moment I was not questioning it.  </p>

<p>“So how do you feel about all that?” she asked. </p>

<p>“I’m think I’m OK with it,” I said. But really, I didn’t know if I was. </p>

<p>In hindsight, I approached my relationship with Carrie in the beginning as one of those fantasy hypotheticals that I had told myself in daydreams that I could always manage—like, what if I lost my job and all my worldly possessions? Why I could just go live in the woods and be fine with a tent and the sky and my own cunning. I could leave it all behind.  </p>

<p>So, yes, I could date a stripper without compunction, even though I’m an overgrown church kid, or maybe especially because I’m an overgrown church kid. There was definitely a “fantasy fulfilled” aspect to dating Carrie. So screw what the world thinks. I like talking to her, she’s smart, and a good person and she must be a hard worker, right? So yes, I can totally date a stripper and not be ashamed or embarrassed or otherwise weird-ed out by it. I can separate the person from the job. </p>

<p>Now dating a stripper is an interesting psychological journey.  </p>

<p>First, Carrie’s concept of money was completely different than anyone I had ever met. She had a lot of it and she spent it very, very freely. In her totally messy condo out in the suburbs, she kept a big brown Rubbermaid trashcan in the corner of her living room.  The trashcan was her version of a piggybank, and it was perpetually full of cash. Small bills as one might guess, but literally enough to necessitate a trashcan. Carrie’s reasoning for the trashcan was very simple: “I hate going to the bank everyday and I have a lot of fucking cash.” Cash was almost a nuisance to her.  </p>

<p>And when you have a lot of cash around, you tend to spend it. And Carrie certainly did: She got haircuts that cost $700. She went to the spa for skin wraps and hot stone massages at least a couple times a week at no less than $400 a visit. In her mind, they were justifiable business expenses, and I could see her point. When your business is your body, you’ve got to make sure it looks good. I was mostly OK with the fact that she made way more money than me, but it did tweak my ego a bit when she would drop the equivalent of one month’s salary for me on a blowout day at the spa. </p>

<p>Perhaps most taxing though, was the lying. Carrie had figured out a long time ago that middle class mid-western society likes to think that the women who work in the strip clubs simply do not exist outside of those darkened halls. It is a job with a stigma. Carrie didn’t tell her parents about what she did. As far as they knew, she still worked in a hospital which she did at one point in time. She didn’t have many friends from what I could discern and some of the ones she had still didn’t know what she did. She lied about who she was on an hourly basis. And as mentally strong as she seemed to be, I could start to see the chinks in her armor.  
<br>After taking the acting class, Carrie became obsessed with the idea of changing her name. I would occasionally find scraps of paper in her bag filled with her perfect script spelling out exotic names like Alpha Tyra Clemens or Gwendolyn Parker Linton, it was the same thing my sister did in junior high with the name of the boy she had a crush on and wanted to see what her first name would look like next to his last name. It was an exercise in identity and it was becoming clear to me that Carrie was tired of being Carrie. 
<br>When I started to tell a few of my close friends about Carrie’s real occupation, the hushed, I-hate-to-ask-but-I’m-going-to-anyway type of questions started rolling in. So like a proper tease: here are the answers to the top five questions you get asked when you are dating a stripper. </p>

<p>Answer #1: Ariana—but I don’t know for sure. She wouldn’t ever tell me. And I did ask. Ultimately, I think her stage name was a part of her business life that she didn’t want mingling with her private life. </p>

<p>Answer #2: Very, very good.  </p>

<p>Answer #3: Yes. </p>

<p>Answer #4: No. but I thought about it. Thought about what it would be like to slink into the back of the club, watch her as she danced up on the stage, watch the men watch her, watch her reaction when she saw me there. I had only ever been to a strip club once in my life for a bachelor party and it was a mostly a sad experience. So I never really had the desire to go.  </p>

<p>Answer #5: No, that was the last thing she wanted to do when she got off work. We mostly watched TV. And she would make me rub her swollen feet while we watched The Daily Show.</p>

<p>And while dating Carrie was mostly really great, the little cautionary voice in the back of my head never fully went away. In fact, it started to get progressively louder. After a month and a half of seeing Carrie, I began to catch myself doing the same thing that Carrie did. I began to tell people that my girlfriend worked in a hospital. And while she may have been comfortable lying about her work, I was not. And the fact of this hit me hard. Eventually, if the relationship were to continue, I would have to tell my parents the truth--my sweet parents who were missionaries for many years. It would not be an easy conversation. “Hey Mom & Dad. I’m dating a stripper. Her skin is like butter. It’s pretty neat.” They’re cool parents, but they’re not that cool. </p>

<p>It’s about this time that my father quite unexpectedly told me in a somber phone call about his close business associate who recently went through a terrible tragedy. Apparently this man’s daughter had recently moved to Manhattan to pursue a dream of dancing on Broadway. When after several months the auditions and her savings had dried up, she started dancing in a strip club. She didn’t tell her parents. Pretty quickly she fell in with a bad guy she met at the club and a month later this guy killed her in a jealous rage, slaughtered her. She was nineteen. </p>

<p>When I told Carrie that story she shrugged it off, but I could not let it go that easily. I was haunted by it. All of her stories about work and the club now seemed to have an air of the dark and dangerous. With her ever-growing identity issues and a failure, in my opinion, to acknowledge the real, vertiginous world in which she lived, I began to feel that our time together was running out.  </p>

<p>And so things ultimately finished with Carrie just as they had started: quickly and without warning. I wish I could say it ended with some dramatic John-Cusack-in-Say Anything-like confrontation wherein I yelled “You have to make a choice, it’s me or your job!” But that didn’t happen. I think Carrie could sense my growing discomfort with her work and while we still had fun together, the exotic thing that had initially excited and attracted me to her was now repelling me with equal strength. The chemistry of desire is interesting that way: attraction and repulsion are often all too mutable things, unchartable and unpredictable, but terribly strong in their power over us. </p>

<p>As the song says, breaking up is hard to do, but in the end, I know I did the right thing for myself.  We parted ways fairly amicably. Sadly, when you are living in an Aerosmith video, you eventually get to the end of the song and it’s just time for Liv Tyler and Alicia Silverstone to return the car they stole  and go back to boarding school. </p>

<p>Still, when I think about my relationship with Carrie now, there is one conversation with her that I tend replay in my head. After we had been dating a few weeks, I asked Carrie the question I had been wanting to ask her from that very first night together at the movies. </p>

<p>“Why me?” I asked her. “I just can’t believe that I’m your type.” </p>

<p>“I don’t click with many people. And I click with you,” she said.  “I don’t know why.” </p>

<p>And god, why can’t that be enough? </p>
