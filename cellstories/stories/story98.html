		</p><p>The kid on the side of the road was wearing a hospital gown.  Yeah, a hospital gown.  Now, if you’re like me, you grew up watching the Halloween movies, and you know to stay away from people wandering the streets in hospital gowns, especially when there isn’t a hospital anywhere in sight.  But he didn’t look like a psychopath.  He looked like a regular kid. He was a skinny Latino boy--maybe 17 or 18--wearing only socks, a grimy pair of sweatpants, and that hospital gown, open in the front and flapping in the breeze. </p>

<p>Normally, I’d be at work or in a rush to get somewhere, but it was my birthday and I’d taken the day off for a little pampering.  My husband Ryan had just picked me up from a fantastic massage and the afternoon was unscheduled.  The traffic was awful, but I didn’t care, Ryan was driving and I was still blissed out from my massage.  Then we noticed the kid near the parking lot of the Popeye’s Restaurant; that hideous Popeye’s that sits on the triangular corner of Damen, Fullerton, and Elston. You know, worst intersection in Chicago!?! </p>

<p>He was leaning with his back against a telephone pole and covering his eyes with a balled up sheet. Every 20 seconds or so, he would pull the sheet away from his face and cringe with his whole body as if the afternoon sun was burning his retinas. </p>

<p>“What do you think is going on here?” I asked Ryan. </p>

<p>“You think he’s a hospital patient?” We both said at the same time--but from which hospital?</p>

<p>“Maybe he lives around here,” I suggested. “Maybe those are his pajamas?” </p>

<p>Ryan teaches teenagers and he shook his head, “No kid that age would leave the house dressed like that.” </p>

<p>“You’re right … Maybe he fell out of the back of an ambulance like in the movies.” I half joked. </p>

<p>“That doesn’t really happen.”  Ryan countered,  “Could he have escaped from a mental ward?” </p>

<p>“That doesn’t really happen, does it?!” </p>

<p>“Besides, where would he come from?” </p>

<p>Ryan asked if I thought we should do anything.  But what was there to do?  Call the police?  How do you think they are going to treat a teenage Latino boy in a hospital gown?  Call an ambulance? It’s likely the police would come along as well.  Should we stop?  Stop?  Stop.  We were both quite for a moment, no doubt each of us remembering warnings from our mothers “Don’t get into cars with strangers!” “Don’t pick up hitchhikers!” “Be careful!” “Watch out!” And of course, my mind went back to Michael Myers and hospital gowns. Blinded by the sun.  The whites of his eyes.  My brain ticked off warnings.  Halloween.  Vampire.  The Exorcist.  We couldn’t stop, could we?  That’s just not safe.  The light cycled another couple of times and we were parallel with the kid.  Should I say something?  “What would you say?” Ryan asked. “Hey!  Are you okay?” </p>

<p>It was clear that this kid was not ok.  It had been six or seven minutes since we first noticed him and he had not stepped away from the telephone pole nor been able to pull the sheet away from his face and every time he tried, his head would jerk like he’d been slapped and his eyes would roll back into his head. </p>

<p>Looking around at the 50 or 60 cars still waiting to get through that damn intersection, I wondered if we didn’t stop, who would? </p>

<p>I pointed at the Popeye’s and told Ryan to pull into the parking lot.  “What are you going to do?” he asked. </p>

<p>“I don’t know.  Just park the car and keep an eye on me.”  I jumped out and cautiously approached the kid while assessing the danger. No one else was in the parking lot and he was clearly not armed. There weren’t any injuries on his arms, torso, or face.  His hair was shiny black and cut short, his face was smooth, and this close he seemed even younger.  His socks even looked clean on top, though the bottoms were soaked and caked with mud. He must have walked a fair distance.  He didn’t notice me, and as his eyes rolled back into his head, I had the strong suspicion that he might actually be a mental patient, but something kept telling me that he was more vulnerable than dangerous. </p>

<p>“Hey.” I said.  “You alright?”  I knew it was a stupid question. “You need some help?” What was I doing? What if he really did need help – like serious help – what could I do for him? “Are you trying to get somewhere?”  </p>

<p>I couldn’t see his expression behind the balled up sheet.  “Wha-what intersection is this?”  he asked me. </p>

<p>“Damen and Fullerton and Elston.” </p>

<p>“What’s the main?” he asked.  I wasn’t sure what he meant.  “What’s the main?” </p>

<p>“It’s Damen.  And Fullerton.”  I told him.  “Fullerton.” </p>

<p>He tried to pull the sheet away from his face so he could see me, but the sunlight was too much. </p>

<p>Where are you coming from?” </p>

<p>“The clinic.” I couldn’t think of any clinic in realistic walking distance.  At least not for a kid in his socks. </p>

<p>“Are you trying to get somewhere?” </p>

<p>“Yeah.” </p>

<p>“Is there somebody I can call for you?” </p>

<p>“Yeah.” He said, “My moms.” </p>

<p>Now we were getting somewhere.  I asked for her number and his name. </p>

<p>“Carlos.” </p>

<p>“Carlos.  What’s your mom’s name? “ </p>

<p>“Maria.” </p>

<p>I punched the numbers into my phone and glanced back to where Ryan was parked.  I could see the concern on his face so I gave him the ok sign.  I got it under control.  The voice that answered the phone had a heavy Latina accent laced with concern.  “Hello?” </p>

<p>“Hello, is this Maria?” </p>

<p>“Yes?” </p>

<p>“Hello, Maria, I am here with Carlos.” </p>

<p>“Oh, Carlos!” </p>

<p>“He asked me to call you.  He wants to come home.” </p>

<p>“Who is this?”  She asked. </p>

<p>“My name is Lott and I was driving by and stopped because Carlos looked like he needed help...” </p>

<p>“Are you police?” </p>

<p>“No, ma’am – I resisted the urge to reply, ‘I’m a good Samaritan! – I just stopped because Carlos looked like he needed help.  Can I bring him home?” </p>

<p>“Oh, he needs to go back to Cook County.” </p>

<p>Cook County.  That felt like a punch to my gut.  I know that they renamed it, but everybody still calls it Cook County.  And it’s not like they changed much more than the name. Once I was there with my friend who had a broken arm and no insurance.  It was dirty and over-crowded and took nearly 10 hours for her to be seen by a doctor, and even the treatment was outdated.  I looked at Carlos and wondered what Cook County must be like for him.  “Well, ma’am, we are here at Damen and Fullerton.  And Carlos wants to come home.  Can I bring him home?” She hesitated and reluctantly said,  “Yes, okay.” </p>

<p>“Okay, Carlos, we’re gonna take you home.  Can you walk on your own or do you want to hold on to me?” </p>

<p>“I want to hold on.” Carlos gently took my arm and I navigated him around a few shallow puddles to the car wondering how the poor kid had made it all the way there from Cook County in his condition. </p>

<p>Inside the car, Carlos settled into the seat and let out a deep sigh.  His whole body relaxed. After a few minutes, his eyes seemed to regain focus, like he had just woken up.  As Ryan drove us west, I turned to talk to Carlos.  “You okay back there? You need anything?  Want some water?” </p>

<p>Carlos declined, politely. I asked him how old he was, and if he worked or went to school.  He said he was 18 and had been taking classes at a community college working toward a two-year degree so that he could go to art school.  He had grown up on the Westside of Chicago and still lived at home and said he liked his neighborhood, but, as he put it, “There are a lot of gangs now.” I met Ryan’s eyes and could tell we were both thinking the same thing:  This was a good kid.  Out of the bright sun, Carlos could see, but he seemed heavily medicated. </p>

<p>Abruptly, Carlos asked, “Why did you guys stop for me?” </p>

<p>I laughed, “Well, man, you looked like you needed help.” </p>

<p>“You could tell by looking at me?” </p>

<p>“Well, Carlos, you don’t see a lot of people on the street dressed like that.” </p>

<p>Carlos looked down and then modestly pulled the hospital gown closed.  “Yeah, I guess I look kind of crazy! But why did you stop.  I don’t know nobody who would stop for me.” </p>

<p>“I don’t know, man.  You seemed kind of out of it, and I just hope that somebody would do that for me.” </p>

<p>“I don’t know what I would have done if you didn’t stop.”  </p>

<p>“So Carlos, your mom said that you were in Cook County?” </p>

<p>He nodded. </p>

<p>“Why were you at Cook County?” </p>

<p>“My head.”   </p>

<p>Ryan shot me a look with raised eyebrows. </p>

<p>“What about your head?” </p>

<p>“It won’t stop hurting, but all they do is give me drugs.” </p>

<p>“What were they giving you drugs for?” </p>

<p>“It hurts,” he said again, “Like…” and he circled his hands next to his temples like he was scrambling his brain.  “I told them I don’t want the drugs.  Don’t like the way they feel.  But they won’t listen.  So I just left.” </p>

<p>“You left on your own?” </p>

<p>“Yeah, I had to get out of there.” </p>

<p>“Well, your mom sounds pretty worried.  Sounds like she loves you a lot.”  I knew it was a jackass thing to say as soon as it came out of my mouth.  Carlos’s lips tightened briefly before his whole face when blank with what was no doubt a learned response to adults who thought they knew something about his life.  </p>

<p>After a few minutes, he told us where to turn and which house was his.  A dark haired woman in a plain red dress was waiting on the front steps.  As I helped Carlos out of the car, the woman approached slowly with her arms clasped across her chest.  Carlos smiled brightly and held his hands out like “Ta Da!”, but she just shook her head and frowned as if to answer, “Not again,” so he stumbled his way toward their front steps. I was suddenly and painfully aware of all the assumptions I had made about this kid and his life.  I really had no idea.  His mother whispered to me, “I don’t know what to do with him.  He’s a little bit schizophrenic. They closed our clinic. We have no doctor.  I have to work.  I can’t stay with him all day.  He has to go back to Cook County. I don’t know what to do.” I remembered hearing how the governor slashed $70 million of funding from the Division of Public Health and my heart ached as I realized how little that had meant to me.  I’ve got a good job.  I’ve got insurance.  That didn’t have any anything to do with me, did it?   </p>

<p>Carlos turned to wave just before he went into the house.  I waved back and said, “Take care of yourself, Carlos.” I got back in the car and slumped in my seat as Ryan drove us away.  We were both quiet for a long time. I realized that I had been caught up with what I thought was a good deed, but in reality, I knew there was nothing more I could do.   </p>

<p>”Hey,” Ryan reached out and gently squeezed the back of my neck.  “You okay?”   </p>

<p>“Yeah,” I nodded.  “I am.”   </p>

<p>“Thank you,” I said.   </p>

<p>“For what?”   </p>

<p>“For that.  For my birthday.  For everything.”   </p>

<p>“We got it pretty good,” he said.   </p>

<p>“Yeah.” I said,  “We do.  We really do.”</p>
