		</p><p>It showed up on Brenna's Blackberry screen just before she dozed off in front of the television. She hadn't been watching it, just staring at the entertainment news show blankly while thinking of waking up in a few short hours. Her phone let out a "twinky twink" and she looked at it crossly for a minute, almost asking "Who the hell do you think you are? No one is texting me at this hour."</p>

<p>But out of curiousity and, let's face it, nothing else to do, Brenna picked up her phone and pushed "READ" on the bottom of the screen that let her know she had one new message in her technological mailbox. It had been a long time since she'd had a real mailbox like that - flag and all.
<br> 
<br>"i know it's been a long time but i need you to know that i forgive you and this has nothing to do with you. i am done pretending to be fine. this is not a cry for help, i just wanted you to know. goodbye." </p>

<p>Brenna read it over a few times, glancing between the message and the number it came from. It was a local area code, but she didn't recognize the number. It wasn't coming up under someone in her phone. As someone who rarely gave her number out, and whose mother consistently asked why she had a PDA in the first place ("You're paying to much for something you don't use," she'd say), this had to be a mistake. And apparently, it would be a big one.</p>

<p>Brenna continued to hold the phone in her hands, staring at the screen, wondering what to do. Should she write the stranger back? Ask who it was? Perhaps notify them it was in error? Maybe they'd get the hint after there wasn't any response. Or, Brenna thought, this could really be a cry for help. She was familiar with reverse psychology, and hadn't she seen something like on "Oprah" one time - suicide victims always tell you they're going to do it because they want you to try and stop them?  </p>

<p>Fuck. She didn't like being put in this position. She was fairly happy being someone that no one felt entitled to cry to. She took her phone back to the couch with her and slumped down, looking up to see an infomercial for a cleaning supply. Thinking about this mysterious text proved much more interesting, and pressing. </p>

<p>She pushed REPLY and began to formulate a quick message. She typed:</p>

<p>"Sorry, wrong number."</p>

<p>Before she hit send, she wondered if this was too short, too cruel - should she be saying something else along the lines of "Don't do it!" or "It's not worth it!" Brenna wasn't sure she agreed with that sentiment. She chuckled. She wasn't depressed enough to be suicidal. Suicidal people did drugs like heroin and had addictions like sex or gambling or secret fantasies about neighbor children. She definitely wasn't like that.</p>

<p>She decided to add one more thing.</p>

<p>"Sorry, wrong number. It'll be OK."</p>

<p>Brenna clicked send before she could change her mind and quickly set the phone down next to her on the couch. She pretended that she wouldn't pay it any mind, and would go back to watching this incredibly interesting program on a celebrity's recent involvement with a reality show competition that seemed to involve the eating of a reptile and the voting off of a twin sister. She tried for several minutes to feign interest in the show, but slowly started to realize her hope was to hear the "twinkle twink" of her phone again.</p>

<p>Commercial break.</p>

<p>"Twinkle twink."</p>

<p>Brenna picked up the phone, sped past the mailbox and onto the reply from the unknown number. </p>

<p>"who is this?"</p>

<p>She scoffed. You're the one texting me! Why did it matter? They didn't know each other, it was a wrong number. How do you respond to that? It reminded her of when she used to answer the phone at parent's house when she was young. Some adult would call and ask "Who am I speaking with?" If you don't know, you probably don't need to be calling, Brenna would think, but she'd politely say "You've reached the Brown residence" and hand the phone off to her mother.</p>

<p>Brenna looked at the time on the cell phone's screen. 2:17 a.m. She wasn't tired anymore, and she was mildly intrigued by the rudeness of the stranger. She responded:</p>

<p>"The wrong number. You have reached someone you don't know."</p>

<p>"Twinkle twink."</p>

<p>"sarah, are you serious right now? this is jill. did u take my number out of your phone"</p>

<p>Brenna rolled her eyes. This person was not getting the idea.</p>

<p>"This is not sarah. I'm sorry, you might have one number off. This is 773-989-9380."</p>

<p>"Twinkle twink."</p>

<p>"this is sarah's number. do you know her? sarah bentley?</p>

<p>Brenna thought for a minute, racking her brain. She only knew a couple of Sarah's, mostly from high school, one from college whose last name was something super Polish - definitely not Bentley. </p>

<p>"No, I don't. I've had this number for a year now. Sorry."</p>

<p>The time crept to 2:37 and there was no "Twinkle twink." Brenna found herself growing sleepy again, her eyelids slowly falling shut, the television still advertising in the background. </p>

<p>"Twinkle twink."</p>

<p>She was startled awake, and noticed the time now read 2:52. She'd dozed off, but wasn't deep enough to miss the new text.</p>

<p>"i've lost her for good then. sorry for the mistake."</p>

<p>Brenna felt sad for Jill and wished she could help. But she'd gotten the number from her carrier, just like any normal customer would. They didn't say "The previous owner has a penchant for suicidal ex-girlfriends." </p>

<p>"It's OK. I hope you find her." She almost ended it with "Goodnight," but thought it might be too formal. She leaned forward and set her phone on the coffee table, standing up and stretching her arms over her head and leaning back with a yawn. It was time for bed now. She'd have to wake up in three hours. The thought depressed her for the fifth time that evening.</p>

<p>Brenna pushed the power button off on the TV remote, picked up her empty tea mug and brought it into the kitchen, taking the tea bag out and gingerly placing it in the trash can and running the faucet into the cup before placing it in the sink. She wiped her hands on her shirt and started toward the bathroom when she heard "Twinkle twink." She paused mid-step, and decided she could brush her teeth after she retrieved her phone from the living room. She walked back into the room and took her phone in hand. She pushed READ.</p>

<p>"i actually feel better knowing she's out of reach."</p>

<p>Brenna turned off the living room light and decided to forgo her bathroom routine for now. She walked into her bedroom and plopped onto the bed, turning on lamp behind her and settling her head on two pillows. She wrote back:</p>

<p>"It's not weird. It's technology. Try her on Twitter."</p>

<p>"Twinkle twink."</p>

<p>"ha i told myself this was the last attempt at messaging her. i learned my lesson."</p>

<p>Brenna was beginning to feel a little more comfortable with the conversation, and decided to find out what the original "message" had meant in the first place.</p>

<p>"Were you trying to kill yourself?"</p>

<p>A few minute passed. Finally, "Twinkle twink."</p>

<p>"i was trying to rid myself of her. i guess she did that for me."</p>

<p>"Twinkle twink."</p>

<p>"btw - what's your name?"</p>

<p>"Twinkle twink."</p>

<p>"if you don't mind me asking."</p>

<p>The clock now read a quarter past 3 and Brenna felt satisfied. She turned her phone on vibrate, put it on the bedside table, switched off the lamp, and went to sleep.</p>
