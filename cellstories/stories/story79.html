		</p><p>'Do something!'</p>

<p>Sound familiar? A demand that requires  an instant reaction. Ignore it and suffer the consequences. Obey it and suffer the consequences. There's no way out. This command was followed by a very clear and concise order:.. 'Catch him!'  </p>

<p>      No need for more information. Just follow her eyes...follow her eyes to the bundle of grey, black, dark brown, God only knew the true colour of the fur in the glow of the street lamp. His – OK, I'm assuming here, so let's assume 'it' was a 'he', as she had also assumed – tongue hung out, dark orange, dribbling like a leaking tap to create a dark stain on the pavement. I could see his eyes and, oh, all right, dammit, there was pleading in them. They said 'I'm lost – do something.' See, even the dog was asking.</p>

<p>      'What do you want me to do?'</p>

<p>      'Catch the poor little thing, see if he's got a name on the collar and a phone number and then call it.'</p>

<p>      I was tempted to ask how I could ring him because dogs didn't have phones and anyway we were right beside him and...well, I'm sure you can appreciate how well that joke would have gone down under what she had decided were urgent circumstances.</p>

<p>      'Here boy!' I said, moving closer, hand raised for a pat on the head. His head, of course. See I'm doing it again. Get serious.</p>

<p>      'He's called Chocolate,' I said, twisting the silver disc on his worn leather collar towards the light. 'No phone number, just an address.'</p>

<p>      'Which is...?'</p>

<p>      'Gee... it's over 100 miles away. Well, the town is, so the street must be, too.'</p>

<p>      'Oh for God's sake, just stop it. Get some rope.'</p>

<p>      'What?'</p>

<p>      'I said Get some rope, take him back to the car and let's drive the poor little thing home.'</p>

<p>      'You didn't say all that. You just said get some rope.'</p>

<p>      'Will you stop behaving like this? Get him to the car and let's take him home. Look at his feet. His claws are raw. He's lost and he's walked all this way. A hundred miles. The poor little thing. Look at his fur – it's like an old sack. And look at his rib bones sticking out. The poor little thing. He must be starving. Is there any food in the car?'</p>

<p>      'Oh sure, what would do you think he'd like? Half a dozen lamb chops, a tin of chicken mince, a - '</p>

<p>      'Stop it! Just help, will you? Just get him into the car and let's drive him home. The poor little thing.'</p>

<p>      A hundred miles. It was already 11.35pm. We'd been for a Chinese. Meal, that is. OK. No mucking about. And don't argue with her any more. Not that I was arguing. As such.</p>

<p>      She sat on the back seat with Chocolate, a tow-rope that I'd kept in the boot attached to his collar. Hell of a lead. It was 12ft long and made of orange nylon. He did look a mess. I could see his dim shape in the rear view mirror as we reached a nearby shopping centre.  He'd probably have quite a good story to tell, if only he could talk. Fancy walking 100 miles. But then they do, don't they? Lost dogs. They just keep on running until they get tired and somebody takes pity on them and takes them to a vet or a police station. Or all the way back home. There was blood on the pads of his feet, she said. Amazing he could walk at all.</p>

<p>      What was that she just said? Blood on the pads of his feet?</p>

<p>      'Did you say he's got blood on the pads of his feet? What about the seat?'</p>

<p>      'Don't worry about it – it will wash off. We've got to get him home, the poor little thing.'</p>

<p>      First stop, a late-night chicken shop. Half a chicken, no stuffing. She insisted he ate it on the back seat. He wolfed it down. Grease and saliva dripping down. That would mix nicely with the blood. Still, it would wash off. She said.</p>

<p>      We were on the highway now. Two heads in the rear view mirror. Both looking forward as the headlights cut into the darkness – and the rain that had started. Driving rain. I don't mean rain that's good to drive in, I mean...well, you know what I mean.</p>

<p>      'He's gone to sleep.'</p>

<p>      'Good for him. How are we going to find this place?'</p>

<p>      'What place?'</p>

<p>      'Well, where he lives. The street directory doesn't cover his town. Who are we going to ask by the time we get there? It'll be well after one and it's raining.'</p>

<p>      'There'll be a filling station or something.'</p>

<p>      'It's a little town in the country for Gawd's sake. There won't be any filling stations and I doubt whether it's got a police station or anything at all that's going to have people who are still awake.'</p>

<p>      'Stop worrying about it. Let's just get there.'</p>

<p>      We drove on in silence for a while. That was because I didn't say anything about the fuel. That mention of the filling station had turned my eyes to the fuel gauge. Why didn't I fill up before we left? Because I was distracted by bloody paws and fried chicken and the smell of a dog which had been on the road for heaven knows how long, that's why. Drop the speed back. We'll get there. Easy does it. Not much traffic around. In fact, no traffic at all. They're all home all nicely tucked up in bed. No reason to be out on the highway in this weather, unless you're being a Good Samaritan.</p>

<p>      'He wants a pee.'</p>

<p>      'What?'</p>

<p>      'He wants a pee. He's restless. You can tell he wants a pee.'</p>

<p>      'Well I'm not stopping here on the highway in this weather. It'll be suicidal if some speeding maniac comes along.'</p>

<p>      'Go down a side road, then. Just to let him out for a pee.'</p>

<p>      I slowed to a crawl. Impossible to see a side road in this weather at night until you're right on it and then it's too late. So I was now inching along, or so it felt, and then I was swinging into a lane. High hedges, nowhere to pull over. Then an open farm gate. In we go. Just on to the edge of the field. The headlights illuminated sheets of rain pummelling the...well, whatever that stalky stuff was...sugar cane, or wheat or, gee, I don't know. Waist-high stuff that farmers grow.</p>

<p>      'Go on then.'</p>

<p>      'Go on then what?'</p>

<p>      'Get out and hang on to his rope while he has a pee.'</p>

<p>      'I'm not getting out in this! Why don't you open the back door, hold the rope, push him out, let him pee and then haul him back in again?'</p>

<p>      'Don't be so ridiculous. Just help the poor little thing. He's shivering with fear.'</p>

<p>      'That's probably because like me he doesn't want to get out into a typhoon.'</p>

<p>      Of course, I didn't win. The moment I stepped out I was very wet and by the time I opened the back door a second later I was soaked. I grabbed the rope and hauled Chocolate out. In a blinding flash, or rather a dark blur, he was gone. I mean really gone. I hadn't even had the chance to get a grip on the rope when he was out of the door and across the sodden landscape. For a moment or two he was illuminated in the headlights, tail between his legs. Boy could he run!</p>

<p>      'Oops!'</p>

<p>      'What did you say out there?'</p>

<p>      'Eh... oops!'</p>

<p>      'Why, what's the matter? Did he pee on your shoe? Serves you right. He's punishing you for being so reluctant. The rain will wash it off, anyway. He did pee, didn't he?'</p>

<p>      'I dunno. He's gone.'</p>

<p>      You must have been in one of those situations when you say something and there's a bit of a lull as your words sink in and you know that what comes next is going to be a little unpleasant. I won't go into all the details here because it did go on for a bit, a lot of words all crammed into a very short space of time, but I'm sure you can use your imagination. But the final sentence was: 'Go on – after him, the poor little thing.' Or words to that effect.</p>

<p>      'There's a torch in the glove box. Can you reach over and hand it out to me?'</p>

<p>      'I can't reach the glove box from the back seat. You ought to know that.'</p>

<p>      Perhaps if I'd sighed I would have felt better but not to worry. I leaned in through the front passenger door and fumbled through the glove box as I showered my back through my clothing. Found the torch. Feared the worst. But hey, it worked. Quite a good beam, in fact. Things weren't so bad after all.</p>

<p>      I set off into the darkness, following the beam of light. I'd left the car headlights on but they weren't much use because I'd last seen Chocolate running off into a black abyss.</p>

<p>      'Chocolate! Here boy!'</p>

<p>      That was the second time I'd said 'Here boy'. Funny how you always say those things to dogs, isn't it? I mean, how did I know whether his owners had ever said 'here boy' because if they hadn't he wouldn't know what I was talking about, would he? And if they had, why would he come to me anyway? Especially as I could hardly hear the sound of my own voice in the rain. And the squelching of the lake in my shoes. Oops. Second time tonight I'd said it. This time was when I tripped on a turnip or something. Down I went with a kind of shhlopp. I pushed on. Some of that stalky, leafy, thingy stuff slapped me in the face. I went down again, this time a slip.</p>

<p>      'Chocolate! Come on Chocolate!' The torch beam stabbed the space between the stalks but no doggy eyes stared back. Chocolate was gone. He could be half a mile away by now. Soft ground for his raw paws, a stomach full of roast chicken, oh yes, he was gone. And so are you, I told myself as I staggered back to the car. I flung open the driver's door and slumped behind the wheel, feeling the water run from my body into the seat.</p>

<p>      'He's soaked, the poor little thing.'</p>

<p>      The voice came from the back seat.</p>

<p>      'What?'</p>

<p>      'He's soaked through. Have you got a towel in the boot?'</p>

<p>      'What!?</p>

<p>      'I asked if you had a towel in the boot. He's soaked through, the poor little thing.'</p>

<p>      I swung around, flicking on the overhead light. Chocolate stared back at me. I could have sworn he was grinning.</p>

<p>      'He came back just after you set off.'</p>

<p>      'Well why didn't you call after me? Why didn't you blast the horn or something?'</p>

<p>      'He barked, you know. Wasn't that clever of him? The door was closed and he was barking to be let in.'</p>

<p>      'Did you hear what I just said? Why didn't you - '</p>

<p>      'I was too worried about Chocolate. I knew you'd be coming back, didn't I? He needed cuddling. Anyway, I couldn't reach the horn from here.'</p>

<p>      It was nearly three o'clock in the morning by the time we reached Chocolate's home, courtesy of directions from a man who was on his way to work at a bakery. The house, with a neat wooden fence around it, was in darkness. As were all the others in the street. But Chocolate was panting, whining in my ear, peering out through the rear side window. He knew his home all right.</p>

<p>      'Just bang on the door – they'll be overjoyed to see him. The poor little thing has probably been missing for weeks.'</p>

<p>      There was a bell. I pushed it. Chocolate sat beside me, tongue hanging out. Anticipation. A light came on. A figure was in the doorway. Big man, white vest. Scratching his head.</p>

<p>      'Huh?'</p>

<p>      'I, eh, brought Chocolate back. We found him. He's a bit wet, but he's OK.'</p>

<p>      He looked at Chocolate, then at me. Then in the semi-darkness I saw his face change. I could tell he was overflowing with emotion. He didn't know whether to laugh or cry. He was very nice about it. Considering.</p>

<p>      On the way back, I looked into the rear view mirror. She still insisted in sitting on the back seat. As did Chocolate.</p>

<p>      We didn't say a word all the way back. At least it had stopped raining. Which is great when you run out of petrol, push the car the last 10 metres into a filling station and wait for someone to arrive at dawn.</p>

<p>      By the time we reached the street where we'd found Chocolate the sun was out.  I pulled up at the very same spot where the night before she'd told me to do something. She got out and stood on the pavement with Chocolate. Now unleashed.</p>

<p>      At that very moment the sun's rays fell on a woman walking down her garden path in a housecoat. She looked at Chocolate.</p>

<p>      'Oh there you are!' she said. 'I've been up and down all night looking for you, worried that you'd done it again. But of course that's not possible any more is it, my little darling.'</p>

<p>      I wound down the window to listen to the rest of her words..</p>

<p>      'Do you know,' said the woman in the housecoat, 'we've had so much trouble with Chocolate since we moved here six months ago. I really did think the therapy hadn't worked, but of course I shouldn't have worried.'</p>

<p>      We both knew what she was going to say. The man in the vest had told us.</p>

<p>      'Yes, when we moved, do you know Chocolate walked all the way back to our old house, 100 miles away. The man who's now living there drove him all the way back to us here, but can you believe he  did it again! That's 200 miles he's walked. That dear man brought him back yet again. I thought he was going to go demented. We had to put Chocolate into therapy. We paid a fortune to have him hypnotised so the image of the old house was totally wiped from his memory. We were assured it would work and it did.'</p>

<p>      She looked down at Chocolate. 'True, isn't it Chocolate? You don't remember the old house any more do you?'</p>

<p>      I started the engine and then we drove home. In silence.</p>
