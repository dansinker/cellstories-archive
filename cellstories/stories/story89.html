<h2>Night on the Town</h2>
	<h3>Amy Braunschweiger</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>With a double shift behind the wheel and oppressive New York City heat dogging him, Stephen Joseph wrapped up his day at 4 a.m. Only the thought of his apartment and his bed a couple blocks away kept him going. He could barely muster the energy to step on the brake as he came to a red light at the corner of Fourteenth Street and Park Avenue South, near Union Square.</p>

<p>      He wasn’t looking for fares when the three girls disregarded his off-duty light and ran screaming up to his cab. Two of the girls carried a boy between them, his arms wrapped around their shoulders and his feet dangled towards the ground.</p>

<p>      Stephen grew up in New York and could tell the girls had been out for a night on the town. It was 1982, and the girls, who looked about eighteen, wore miniskirts and had fluffed and moussed their long, curly black hair. The boy appeared to be unconscious, although he seemed to be trying to move his feet to walk.</p>

<p>      He rolled down the window. “Listen, I’m off duty,” he said.</p>

<p>      “No, no, he’s been stabbed,” one of the girls wailed hysterically. “He’s been stabbed!”</p>

<p>      Stephen looked at the boy, and for the first time saw the gaping, bloodless wound in his hairless chest. He was Hispanic and looked only seventeen. One of the girls held his bloody T-shirt, soaked so completely that Stephen couldn’t make out the shirt’s original color.</p>

<p>      “Can you please take him to the hospital?” she begged, crying.</p>

<p>      In the 1980s, New York City symbolized urban decay with a well-earned reputation for gang violence, crack, organized crime and murder. Times Square housed hookers and seedy strip joints instead of Toys ‘R’ Us and the ESPN sports bar. The Lower East Side—today known for nouveau American cuisine and overpriced vintage shops—was known for heavy drug activity and guns. In fact, according to FBI statistics, between 1982 and 2007, New York’s murder rate plunged by seventy percent, and the number of robberies plummeted a whopping seventy-seven percent from 95,944 to 21,787. A total of 107,430 vehicles were reported stolen in 1982, compared with 13,256 in 2007.</p>

<p>      Although he had never been robbed or menaced, Stephen recognized the danger he faced as a cabbie. He was always a little afraid, and always wary. He was also careful of who he picked up. If two or three guys wearing sneakers and hoodies standing near the Lower East Side’s housing projects tried to hail him, he would drive right by. </p>

<p>      “I wasn’t worried about being politically correct,” he said. “It wasn’t based on color, it was based on class. It was where they were, how they were standing, how they were dressed, what time of night it was.”</p>

<p>      A native New Yorker who often worked in rough neighborhoods as an English teacher, Stephen had a good feel for what to avoid as a cabbie.</p>

<p>      “In those days, there were a lot of hold-ups, there was violence against private cabs, and the gypsy cabbies were getting killed right and left,” he said.</p>

<p>      He had known one murdered cabbie. His friend’s father was shot in the head during a robbery that took place at 116th Street and Second Avenue near the Metropolitan Hospital. The man died a couple of weeks later.</p>

<p>      Despite his concerns, Stephen still occasionally picked up someone he considered “borderline,” then spent the entire ride wondering when he’d get cracked over the head.</p>

<p>      “It’s a very strange feeling to have somebody sitting behind you,” he said. “You have the feeling or sense that they could rob you or have a weapon. And you feel very helpless because you have your back turned.”</p>

<p>      His greatest fears as a driver were being killed or running over a pedestrian. He never considered the fact that someday, someone other than himself might die in his cab.</p>

<p>      On the night of the stabbing, Stephen had already driven a double shift, and he expected to drive a total of thirty hours that weekend.</p>

<p>      “I didn’t say it, but my first thought was that he’s going to bleed all over my cab and I’ll have to clean it up,” Stephen said. “It’s not a very charitable thought, but it’s what I thought.”</p>

<p>      But he knew he couldn’t just drive away. He told them to get in. One girl clambered into the front seat, weeping. The other two crying girls held the silent boy in the back seat.</p>

<p>      Stephen knew the area—he lived further down Fourteenth Street in Stuyvesant Town, a complex of often rent-controlled apartment buildings. The nearest hospital, Beth Israel, was about six or seven blocks away.</p>

<p>      “I floored it and went through all the lights, went left on Sixteenth Street, turned there and drove right up the ramp where the ambulances go,” Stephen said. “Some workers came out and were waiting there. ‘You can’t come here, it’s just for ambulances,’ the workers yelled. I called out, ‘I have somebody who’s been very seriously injured, he got stabbed!’”</p>

<p>      The hospital staff saw the boy, stopped arguing and grabbed a gurney. They hoisted the boy up, hurriedly tossed his bloody shirt on top of him, and rushed him into the building.</p>

<p>      The girls begged Stephen to take them back to the club. The boy’s brother had been stabbed, too, they said, and they needed to bring him to the hospital as well.</p>

<p>      “I was already so upset at his point and I figured, whatever, what the hell,” he said. “It was a five-minute ride. I couldn’t say no.”</p>

<p>      When he neared the club, the cops had already arrived, red and blue lights flashing along the street. Stephen pulled up and a cop walked over.</p>

<p>      “You can’t get in here,” the cop said.</p>

<p>      Stephen explained that he came to pick up someone who was hurt, someone who needed to go to the hospital. The girls cried in his cab. The cop asked Stephen his name. He gave his real first name and lied about his last, saying it was Jacobs. He didn’t want to get mixed up in legal issues—human issues were enough.</p>

<p>      “I was hoping he wouldn’t take my medallion or license number,” Stephen said. “He didn’t seem to—he just wrote whatever I told him in the book.”</p>

<p>      The cop informed them that an ambulance had already taken the boy’s brother to the hospital. So Stephen backed up, turned around, and drove back to the hospital. On the way, the girls told him their story. They lived in the Bronx, and had brought the boy to the city as a treat. He had never been to a nightclub before, and they wanted to show him the ropes on a Saturday night. They told him to wear khakis and a T-shirt.</p>

<p>      “The fight started over something really senseless,” Stephen said. “It was some kind of argument over somebody making fun of one of the girls or his clothes.”</p>

<p>      The boy got in a pushing match with some other guys at the club, they went to square off, and the other guy—right in the middle of the club—pulled out a knife and plunged it into the boy’s heart.</p>

<p>      Stephen pulled up to the emergency room, and the girls rushed out. A nurse told them that the boy’s brother had only been stabbed in the shoulder; the wound wasn’t life-threatening. With the girls out of the cab and the boys in the hospital, Stephen could finally head home. He was almost there, anyway. He only lived one block from the hospital. In fact, he parked his car on the same block. He had planned on driving the next day—Sunday—but was too upset. Instead, he went to his friends’ beach house near Atlantic Beach, ten miles east of Kennedy Airport. He wanted to find out what happened to the kid, so that afternoon he picked up the New York Daily News, late edition, and found the story. Apparently, a number of people were hurt in the brawl, but there was only one fatality, a fifteen-year-old who died of a stab wound. The kid.</p>

<p>      The newspaper included the boy’s address, and Stephen tracked down the family’s phone number though information.</p>

<p>      “I called their house a number of times the following night,” he said. “I just wanted to tell whoever answered, his parents or whoever, that I had been involved and to give them my condolences, even though they were strangers.”</p>

<p>      But nobody answered. He never called again. Authorities never caught the guy who stabbed the boy.</p>

<p>      Stephen doubts the boy was dead when he got in the cab. If he were, the two girls wouldn’t have been able to hold him up, he theorizes. The boy would have been dead weight.</p>

<p>      “I think he died in the cab,” he said. After all, there was no blood in the taxi when they got out. “He’d already done all his bleeding.”  </p>
