<h2>Simon</h2>

		</p><p><i>Picture Chicago December, 2007.  It was wintery-white outside and I was sitting at the Intelligencia downtown at Randolph and Wabash and I could barely see through the foggy café windows.  </i></p>

<p>The barista called out ‘Simon’--and I saw him, in his leather jacket with his thick dark hair, saunter up to retrieve his drink. I jumped to my feet, coffee sloshed onto my table. I started toward him, then caught myself. Just a sign. Leather jacket.  God speaking through the shaggy tattooed barista, assuring me that Simon was still alive on this earth. </p>

<p>See, I’ve been trying to tell this story for almost a year now and I still haven’t been able to. Because I’ve been waiting all this time, to see how it ends.  By December of last year, I’d been on the look out for four months, praying the prayers of my childhood, searching for signs--for my friend, Simon, sent back to Iraq for the third time, another sixteen-month tour. With a wife and two little boys waiting at home, he was out there, again. </p>

<p>Simon is one of the very few that I have kept in touch with since first meeting him as a 7th grader at JB Thomas Junior High in Hillsboro Oregon, nearly 25 years ago. </p>

<p>Sometimes months, often years would pass between letters but eventually I’d hear from him, stationed at Ft. This or Ft. That.  He’d send a picture, tucked into a Christmas card, or a letter – my favorite was one on thick Army stationary, written in his ALL CAPS script, from barracks in South Korea, near the city where I was born.  He told me about the streets of Seoul, the gritty night life, how there was no warm reception for American soldiers, and I remember trying to imagine him there amidst the details he described, a place that holds not a single familiar detail for me. </p>

<p>The last time I saw Simon face-to-face was over 10 years ago, here in Chicago.  He and an Army buddy came through and I’ve got a picture of him and me by the water, both of us squinting into the sun. </p>

<p>But even though most of the photos I have of him are crew cut or Army clad, I still envision the high-school version of Simon – with hair down to his shoulders, sporting a leather jacket and mischievous grin – I see him strutting down the hall between classes, a devilish twinkle in his eye and a giggly girl skittering after him.  I remember staring at his pierced ear during play practice wondering how much it had hurt (since I didn’t have mine pierced yet).  He drove his mustang crazy-fast, and was one of those boys that made your stomach flip-flop and your face betray you – Simon was heavy metal, cigarettes and had the strongest jaw I’d ever seen.   But he was also a boy who had this deep sense of honor in his guts.  I don’t know how I knew that way back then, but I did.  </p>

<p>So, over the decades we wrote.  1989, Simon in Scotland and me still in high school, sending letters back and forth on that thin blue airmail stationary.  1991, sent from my first apartment in Seattle, to the base where he was stationed in Alabama.  Then it was e-mails to and from North Carolina, Colorado, Chicago, and eventually care-packages heading to Iraq.  *I remember getting an email over seven some years ago simply saying, “I’ve met the woman I’m going to marry.”  And another, a while later, with wedding pictures attached.  And so it went for a dozen years until 2001, September 11th to be exact.  </p>

<p>After that, when I got an email from Simon, my stomach would flip-flop for an entirely different reason.  Because if it wasn’t a photo of his sweet little boy dressed as a pumpkin for Halloween, or one of him or his wife cradling their beautiful newborn, it meant he was being shipped out.  And I would take sanctuary in the faith of my youth – and start searching for signs.   </p>

<p><i>I remember the barista repeated “Simon?” and slid his drink across the counter. I stood there in the café, staring at that pseudo Simon and watched him doctor his drink.  As he poured a white stream of sugar into his cup, I saw he wore glasses because the steam was smudging his lenses.  More fog on window panes. </i></p>

<p>When I saw that, another memory settled over me.  Just a few weeks earlier, in November, I had been back home in Hillsboro.  </p>

<p><i>I was peering out the backseat window of my parent’s car, feeling like a little kid, like 20 years hadn’t passed since I’d left home.  I was waiting to step out into a cemetery on a wet gray Oregon day.  The fog had wrapped around us like gauze and the damp chill slithered into the car and up the back of my neck.  I traced circles on the windowpane feeling smaller and smaller.  My mom said, ‘Well, I think it’s time.”  And so we went.
<br> 
<br>We stood under a sturdy wooden shelter as my grandpa’s burial began.  Shots were fired from white rifles with a crack that made me think of toy Christmas poppers. A uniformed man (he looked more like a young boy) raised his trumpet to his lips, and I heard those first three notes, immediately recognizable… the third note held out pure and rich and cutting the silence, only the rain dripping from the shelter eaves interrupted the stillness. </i></p>

<p>These strangers in uniform stood before us and performed rituals, with precisely choreographed moves, measured steps and prepared faces.  It was mesmerizing.  I’m not sure if I was more compelled by the complete formality and foreignness of their actions or by the respect the soldiers gracefully gave my grandfather, a man they never even knew.  When they stood at attention and saluted, I imagined Simon in uniform, some formal Army attire, dressed for an event that required white gloves – and wondered if he was safe.</p>

<p>The unfolding and folding of the flag was captivating. The crisp movements, the rotation of the fabric, the three soldiers’ keen accuracy. I imagined them practicing this task in casual clothes.  With some other piece of fabric, perhaps. </p>

<p>My grandma was handed the flag and shell casings.  I saw her lips move as she said ‘Thank you’ but no sound came out.  She was bundled in a thick puffy coat but she still looked so cold.  My mom was in her usual lightweight maroon jacket, and I imagined her thin pale fingers chilled to the bone.  I looked at her again, hands scrunched into her coat pockets, and saw her as someone other than my mom.  I saw her as someone’s daughter. </p>

<p>As the service ended the rain pattered on the shelter roof and I stood there twisting the silver and turquoise ring on my middle finger that my grandpa made for me when I was a little girl.  We hurried to our cars and drove in procession to the site where my grandpa would rest in peace.  
<br>And as we passed a memorial with lists of other names, military men and women, I read the chiseled heading: KOREAN WAR.  ‘Korean War’ I thought.  Soldiers here who fought in my homeland and came back to be buried in theirs.  I thought of the letter Simon sent from Korea, pictured it in my file drawer, being kept safe.  </p>

<p>I haven’t been able to let myself pull out his old letters.  But I’m extremely curious when the last hand written letter was dated, when the Army stationary became electronic messages in my inbox.  Email has helped with the anxiety of waiting and wondering about Simon’s safety.  And this third tour, for the first time, we’ve even had the immediacy of Instant Messaging.  There’s an eight-hour difference between us, which has me in the middle of my downtown workday, seven floors above Michigan Avenue, and has him moving into the night, at his unit’s location… somewhere. </p>

<p>“Whoah, felt that” he’d type as he described some explosion nearby. </p>

<p>“Are you serious?!” I reply, immediately feeling foolish and naïve. </p>

<p>“A boy was killed in the crossfire today.  I had to find the body.” He continued. </p>

<p>“My God, Simon…” I trail off.  I want to write “I’m so sorry” but I’ve already typed those words ten times this conversation. </p>

<p>“We joked about his shoes.” </p>

<p>“His shoes?” I type back. </p>

<p>“Yeah, his shoes.  They were shiny.” </p>

<p>“You and the guys?  You joked about his shoes? I write. </p>

<p>“Yeah.” </p>

<p>“Why?” I pursue. </p>

<p>“Because they were really shiny.” </p>

<p>I remember waiting for him to continue typing, but nothing came up. </p>

<p>“Does it help?” I write back. </p>

<p>There’s no response.  But that could have been the connection, which has a habit of kicking him offline.  Whatever the reason, I don’t repeat my question. </p>

<p>“I talked to my wife today, got caught up on the kids.” </p>

<p>“Yay!” I respond. </p>

<p>“It was great to hear about everyday things.   And then she asked me how my day was. I said it was pretty boring.” </p>

<p>“Was it?” I ask. </p>

<p>“No.” </p>

<p>“Was that more for her or for you?” I ask. </p>

<p>“For me.” </p>

<p>Again, I don’t press.  Because, I feel completely inadequate, completely ill-equipped to offer anything but a “listening ear”. </p>

<p>“It’s so hot here,” he types. </p>

<p>But from where I sit, I see full gray threatening storm clouds outside.  The sky is about to pour down on Chicago. And I am brought back to my grandpa’s cemetery and how the rain had made the earth so soggy. When I walked out to the gravesite, the fresh dirt beneath my feet gave way and my shoes sunk in.  Temporary green markers were lined up in rows, more precision.  I thought of the ground I stood on, wet dark soil, and the ground Simon stood on, dry tan sand. </p>

<p>After my grandpa’s burial, I started having nightmares.  Not about him, but about Simon.  I would be wandering through that cemetery looking for his headstone.  But the ground would be too muddy, and I couldn’t keep my footing and the green markers would be all out of line.  I would wake in a panic wondering if I was being sent some message from the other side. </p>

<p>So, Simon was scheduled to come home December of this year, completing the 16-month term.  But last month, I got another email.  “I HAVE NEWS” the subject line read.  I remember being temporarily paralyzed, images of wounded soldiers bloodying my brain – Reading on he wrote, ‘I’m now scheduled to head to Kuwait mid-October, should be home before the end of the month.’  Yes!  This was news indeed.  Then the email continued, ‘Just one more mission October 10.”  </p>

<p>‘You’ve got to be kidding!’ I slapped my hand against my desk so hard my palm hurt.  I mean, come on!  Isn’t that the most predictably painful plot twist in every war movie you’ve ever seen?  Just ONE last mission, just ONE more flight out… </p>

<p>The day before his last mission, October 9, I started counting hours, as if I were fingering the beads of a rosary, adding 8 to every Chicago hour – 8 am would be 4pm, 4pm would be midnight, midnight would be 8am.  Of course, I had no idea if it was a night mission, or the duration, or location, so I prayed more panicked prayers, and waited.  I heard nothing for several days. </p>

<p>Finally I got an email and as it turned out, Simon flew the mission days earlier then planned, “They must have known it was my last mission,” he commented, “There was more gunfire than I’ve seen in months – but I won, they lost.”  Even in my relief, I remember wishing I’d said prayers for the other side too. </p>

<p>Prayers.  How does that saying go?  “There are no atheists in foxholes.” </p>

<p>As each week passes I wait to hear that he’s made it home, I faithfully find myself at church on Sunday morning.  I make it to the early service (where there are only a handful of folks) and during the time when the congregation is invited to speak the prayers of the people, I find my voice and say “A prayer for my friend Simon in Iraq” and those around me respond, “Lord hear our prayer.” </p>

<p>So – it’s now November 9, a good solid week into November.  October, mid-October, and the end of October can safely be considered in the past.  I have sent three emails to Simon but have had no response.  I know he was stationed in Colorado last, and I believe that’s where his wife and boys were living when he was shipped out.  But in this time of email and instant messaging, I have no home number, no return address.  I googled ‘Army Bases in Colorado’ and there is one, Ft. Carson.  But, what do I do with that information even?  Call up and ask for…what?  What do I ask?   </p>

<p>So I wait.</p>

<p>And while I’ve been waiting, I have broken my old habit of picturing the long-haired, high school Simon.  I’ve pushed myself to shift that image to the more recent photos I have of him in his Army uniform, next to a helicopter, even the one with a gun at his side.  I need to see him as the 38-year-old husband and father, who has survived death in the dessert – twice for sure.  Because then I can more easily replace that image with the last photo he emailed while he was home on leave this spring.  It’s a beautiful picture of him, and his wife, and their two little boys, sitting on the front stoop of their home.  I picture this, say another prayer, and think – maybe, somehow – this will help get him home. </p>
