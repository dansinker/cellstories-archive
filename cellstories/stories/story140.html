<h2>Digital Ash In A Digital Urn </h2>

		</p><p>Twigg was an English paparazzo. Good at it. He was never off duty. </p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>He took his time snapping the actor kid throwing up on his back seat, and then in a gutter, somewhere between Chelsea Embankment and Putney. His loyalties weren’t divided between what was happening to his upholstery and the job. It was always the job. The kid, William, had junk in his beard and hair, and was crying.</p>

<p>      ‘I thought you said you wouldn’t take any pictures. You promised.’</p>

<p>      ‘Lift your head a little. I got you away from that rabble, didn’t I?’</p>

<p>      ‘You’re still scum.’</p>

<p>      He spat something hard against Twigg’s headrest. Bile or carrot.</p>

<p>      ‘I’m driving you to your Mum’s in Weybridge. Gotta get something out of it.’</p>

<p>      The kid’s face momentarily brightened, in recollection of a more ordinary time when he wasn’t falling about in nightclubs and jeopardising the careers of promising females with his penis/Class A combo. Regressed to packet soups and A-level sleepovers.</p>

<p>      ‘Like petrol money?’</p>

<p>      ‘Spot on. Petrol money. Look into the lens for me.’</p>

<p>      The only thing complicated about this kid was his threads. Aside from those he was putty. He didn’t even mind that his hair was messed up.</p>

<p>      It was nothing to do with the stench of vomit. Twigg always drove with the windows down. A wind-swept barnet guaranteed an extra £500 minimum. It was the easiest add-on there was. </p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>Saturdays were for footballers pissing into nightclub topiary and spitroasts in boutique hotels.  He’d photographed more players strolling out of spitroast venues than he’d had Carvery. Depending on the players involved, it was lucrative, but tedious.</p>

<p>      Twigg wasn’t a pap snob like some of the older boys who were only interested in following people if they’d been on BBC1. If there was value to taking a picture, he took it. Just, anything that took him out of the sport egos was welcome. He couldn’t bear to pander to those who had such a sick attitude to girls. He’d been there. He’d seen it. </p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>‘Remind me what I’m doing in your car?’</p>

<p>      ‘I thought you were sobering up, William.’</p>

<p>      ‘The gear makes everything last longer. It’s gonna take a while.’</p>

<p>      ‘They were legging it after you on Oxford Street because you were wandering up the road trying to find your driver. Dunno how you expected to find him running the way you were. Lucky I’d left the car parked on the corner.’</p>

<p>      ‘Those evil security. Told me he was right outside.’</p>

<p>      ‘It’s been a difficult night. Everyone was on edge.’</p>

<p>      ‘Jumped-up bunch of hooligans. That’s the last time I go to that place. They find hard to deal with anything above the level of soap stars. Don’t they know who I am?’ </p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>Oxygen cleared heads. William’s chat became less hostile as they left town behind and reached the A3. Just gone 4am and the only ones on the road. An asphalt artery turned ghost.  Twigg was the one having trouble, unable to expel the vomit fumes completely. His nostrils were full of it no matter how hard the cold air pummelled his face.</p>

<p>      He pulled into the first lay-by and began the clean up, roughly pulling William out the passenger door to get some blood circulating in his legs whilst he mopped and dabbed unhindered.</p>

<p>      ‘I remember now! You’re the one who found my shoe! I lost it when it kicked-off outside Punk. You went back to get it.’</p>

<p>      ‘See, I’m not all bad, am I?’</p>

<p>      Talking made things worse. The stench that rotted his nasal passage now sticking in the back of his throat.</p>

<p>      ‘You’re my champion. They should crown you Royal Shoe Collector, or something.’</p>

<p>      ‘I’m not planning on making a habit of it. Maybe you should wear laces in your shoes next time.’</p>

<p>      Thick, like film. Like venom. No swallowing action could disperse it.</p>

<p>      ‘Um, maybe. I had these babies made for me in Italy. Two grand they cost.’</p>

<p>      Whilst the kid continued to witter – they were all the same once they got started on money - Twigg crouched in front of the bonnet and wretched quietly. Something disagreeable in whatever the kid had been ingesting: bad prawns, GHB, crack? He was toxic with it.</p>

<p>      William, walking the length of the lay-by, all three-car stretch of it, pointed to a bundle at the kerb.</p>

<p>      ‘Broken bottles! D’you want me to lie next to them, so you can take some pictures?’</p>

<p>      ‘No. You’re alright.’</p>

<p>      ‘They might be better than some of the other ones you’ve taken. I’m still a bit wasted, so it’ll still show on my face.’</p>

<p>      ‘Get in the car, William. It’s too cold to be lying about in the middle of the road. Your Mum’ll kill me, if I deliver a pneumonic-ridden boy to her front door.’</p>

<p>      ‘’Spose. Just that I saw you took some pictures like that before. The daughter of that junkie who became a junkie, wasn’t it? Everyone was talking about them for over a week.’</p>

<p>      He bundled him back into the car. They always saw the glamour in everything, these new kids. Everything was a game. The junkie daughter was only lying on broken glass because she wanted to kill herself. He should know. He was the one who’d taken the pictures. Another occasion where he regretted getting over-involved.</p>

<p>      It never paid to get too friendly with these people. They only took liberties. </p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>It looked crueller than it was. They were painted as hard bastards, the paps, but none of them were, really. They were all big softies, who welled-up at the end of Shrek, or when their kid scored at the weekend five-a-side. It was only the camera around their necks that stopped them from turning to mush. Strapped to the chest, it shielded the heart from all emotional triggers. </p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>A kid crying his eyes out, sicking up so unguardedly, was either a Page 1 or a Page 3, tops. It was the thought of the front page credit that kept him awake as he floored it down the A3.</p>

<p>      William was sleeping now, which made things easier. He pulled over for a second time and rattled off a round of face shots. A grainy, unidentifiable crust on the beard, and the mahogany-to-black half moons under both eyes filled the frame. They’d be good for Heat or one of the other mags that appreciated the beauty of the extreme close-up. Snoring boy was none the wiser.</p>

<p>      Others may have been more considerate, but saying ‘there there’ and giving them a mug of tea wasn’t going to stop their tantrum-meltdown. He’d learned the hard way with the junkie daughter.  He may as well snap now, tea later.</p>

<p>      He got the blanket out the boot and covered him attentively before starting off again. Even snotty shaggers should be protected from cold.</p>

<p>      That girl,  had tried to make a prick out of him, but he’d showed her, hadn’t he? There was no picture that wasn’t worth taking, so long as he used his brains.  </p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>He struggled to pinpoint what sent him fighting his way through the wall of muscle and flashlights that spilled around the Punk’s velvet rope and onto the bus lane on Oxford Street to look for a shoe. Moments before he’d enjoyed the quiet satisfaction of knowing that he’d got his shot of William and his date, the girl who’d won the modelling competition.</p>

<p>      From a side window opposite Soho Square he snapped them, snogging by the cloakroom whilst they waited for their respective cars to turn up.</p>

<p>      But his call to action had less to do with his camera, more the behaviour of the others. Seeing the boy’s own look of pleasure being ripped from his face before he was ready, as his ‘colleagues’ scrambled around the entrance to take his picture. All night they’d been unusually rowdy and not in the mood to play games. </p>

<p>      He wasn’t anything, William. A couple of moderately successful British films, and a reputation for being a shagger. Every bar in London was packed with such average achievers. But the girl was a catch, the newest redtop sweetheart, and they wanted their scoop.</p>

<p>      The rabble pushed against the velvet rope. Security, normally alright, remembered their marine training and elbowed a path to the car. The unfit men with cameras elbowed back. Everyone had something to prove except William, who was jostled and tugged at, until he lost balance and fell to the floor. Shoe skidding off at speed like a roller skate.</p>

<p>      At times like this the job didn’t sit right. Twigg liked the night shift, but he wasn’t cut out for warfare on the red carpet. Probably once or twice a year he felt what he was feeling now: helpless, impotent. He wanted to argue that it was something he had no control of, that it was talent’s job to keep their masks up, and that he was only there to take the pictures. But there were occasions when a loss of innocence resounded deeply with him. He wasn’t at the forefront of the pack, shouting the boy’s name like he was guilty of murder, but he still felt responsible. William had slipped in not disguising the mist that had clouded his eyes post-kiss. That was the crime. There was none of the swagger he had with other girls. Something more serene.  It always spelt trouble.</p>

<p>      Someone needed to make amends. At the very least, good footwear shouldn’t be left in the street. Twigg swore under his breath and in a crawl position, began to look for the shoe.  </p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>The addition of family could break through the recommended price guide, depending on their reaction. William’s mum was promising. From her bewildered expression on opening the front door that time of night, to her shrieks at the state of him. The tightness of her hold, her waterworks, that was the icing. A reunion played out on the front step. A twenty second tableaux that netted another ten decent shots. It helped that he’d made sure that the back of William’s coat was smeared with sick. Captured on the night-vision lens it clung to his back like an essence of his true druggy self; the one he tried so hard to hide from his mother.</p>

<p>      Twigg never had qualms about involving family. They had to be good for something. His parents had emigrated to Australia when he was 16, leaving him with his Nan and Grandad in New Malden.  He stopped trying to figure it out after a couple of years. Then he picked up a camera and worked out how to use it.</p>

<p>      The front door closed without a final wave of recognition from William, but that he was expecting. Never acknowledge, never thank. They lived in a different world, these people – so long as the world remained their oyster.</p>
