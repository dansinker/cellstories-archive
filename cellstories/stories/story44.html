<h2>Treasure Trail</h2>
	<h3>Derek McCormack</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>I had to stand in a cornfield, arms spread scarecrow-style.  Straw hat, cord suit.  Wormy husks up my sleeves and down my neck.</p>

<p>Just past sundown a bunch of people rode by on a hay wagon. </p>

<p>A gal with a megaphone said, "Rumour has it Wendell hid out in these parts.  He lived on berries and innocent children..."</p>

<p>I hollered and charged the wagon.  Kids shrieked. Parents hugged them, pointed at me and laughed.</p>

<p>Every half-hour another wagonload rumbled by. At 11 the driver drove down alone. </p>

<p>"I’m Pete," he said.</p>

<p>"Good for you," I said. </p>

<p><h4>*</h4></p><p>The megaphone gal gabbed about ghosts and ghouls as the first wagonload of the night rolled away.</p>

<p>I had a smoke. I jacked off. I wandered to the edge of the field and scaled the snake fence. Wading through tallgrass I tripped on a wheel.  It was sticking straight up out of the ground.  I found another one about five feet away.  I began digging with my hands.</p>

<p>In the wagon Pete asked how I’d gotten dirty.</p>

<p>"You tell the boss and I’ll kill you," I said.</p>

<p>He traced an X on his chest.  “Cross my heart.”</p>

<p>"There’s a hay rake buried out there." I pointed.</p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p>"So?" I said. "People’ll pay lots for shit like that. It’s an antique."</p>

<p><h4>*</h4></p><p>Next shift I took a shovel. I managed to unearth the rake’s seat and prongs. But I had to keep running back to the cornfield to spook brats. One kid in snow pants started bawling. I rushed her. She grabbed my sleeve and chomped down on my fingers.</p>

<p>"Goddammit!" I yelled.</p>

<p>The boss was waiting by the barn after work. "Young man this is a family ride," he said. "Any more cussing and you’re out of here!  History!  Understand?"</p>

<p>I hung my head. Out the corner of my eye I watched Pete park and lock the wagon. </p>

<p><h4>*</h4></p><p>"What a dope," Pete said next night.  We passed a pasture planted with cardboard tombstones.  "He didn’t even ask what happened."</p>

<p>"Tell me something pal," I said. "The boss let you keep the keys to this thing?"
<br>      
<br>He shrugged. "Sure."</p>

<p>"Let’s say you wanted to borrow it."</p>

<p>"No problem.</p>

<p>"Suppose you didn’t ask."</p>

<p>The Haunted Barn, The Haunted Mini-Golf Course, The Haunted Snack Shack.  Lights were out at the boss’s house.  A jack-’o-lantern asleep on the stoop. </p>

<p><h4>*</h4></p><p>Next shift I dug down to the rake’s tongue.  The soil beneath it was froze.  I climbed onto the seat and jacked off.</p>

<p> The wagon rumbled closer.</p>

<p>I jammed my dick into my cords and ran. My right foot slid into a groundhog hole. I tumbled. The wagon’s headlights grew bright.</p>

<p>"It seems the scarecrow’s gone,” said the megaphone gal. “Where could it be?"</p>

<p>"Here I am!" I yelled. I rose and staggered toward the wagon. "Here I am you fucking little bitch!"</p>

<p>Later on Pete idled the wagon beneath a rag-stuffed dummy dangling from an elm. He peeled off my boot and sock.</p>

<p>I faked a sob. "What am I gonna do?" I said. "I needed this job."</p>

<p>"This sucks," Pete said.  "You hurt yourself making money for Mr. Moore.  One little mistake and he’s all over you." He slammed the gear stick into drive.  I’ll help you get that rake," he said.  "Just say when." </p>

<p><h4>*</h4></p><p>Halloween night I knocked out two sections of the snake fence. Near midnight Pete showed up in the wagon. We backed up to the rake, roped its rear beam to the wagon’s hitch.</p>

<p>"I reckon it’ll take one good tug," Pete said jumping into the cab.</p>

<p>The engine revved, the rope tensed, the rake groaned. Crack!--the beam snapped. Prongs and chunks of wood flew into weeds.</p>

<p>Pete leapt out. "Did we get it?" he said. </p>

<p>"Get it?" I screamed. "You fucking idiot you broke it!"</p>

<p>I slugged him in the kisser. He hit the dirt. </p>

<p>"C’mon candyass!" I screamed. "Get up and fight!"</p>

<p>Blood trickled from his nose.</p>

<p>"Pete?" I nudged him with my boot.  Straddling his hips I pushed his sweater up to his arm pits. I listened to his heartbeat. I licked his nipples. I unbuckled his belt.</p>
