<h2>Bedtime Stories</h2>
	<h3>Lane Ashfeldt</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>This is what I miss most about changing lovers: I miss having a new face up close to mine, eyes to watch, telling stories.</p>

<p>Sex? I don’t mind it, or when it’s good it’s all I can think about for days, a feeling that can’t be switched off. But what I really miss are those moments when you refashion yourself for the next person in your life. When time stands still and you have endless curiosity about each other and want to fill in the blanks.</p>

<p>My friend Jude tells me this is called Romance.</p>

<p>I thought Romance was going somewhere cheesy and expensive for dinner, with pink napkins and too shiny cutlery. I thought Romance was dead and buried. Beyond resurrection.</p>

<p>Jude says maybe it’s so dead it’s about to make a comeback.</p>

<p>So now that I’ve packed all that in, that boygirl or girlgirl or whatever stuff, I have plenty of time to decide which were the greatest of my unromantic encounters. My personal Best Of.</p>

<p>Some of the best were the one-nighters when it didn’t even get as far as a bed. The guy I met when I was seventeen, in that town I only stopped in for a night. It was after midnight and I was headed back to the cruise ship where I worked, when I spotted him. He looked good, and he smiled at me from behind a window and came outside. We didn’t speak the same language, and it was embarrassing because his friends followed him out, but we just kissed like crazy until we made them go. Then we found a park where we lay on a roundabout while the dark sky went round and round, faster and faster, until the tall buildings fell in on top of us and I fell totally, dizzily in love with him.
<br>He asked me back to his, but I had to go.</p>

<p>The pleasure boat was making ready to pull out when I finally reached it some time close to dawn, and I almost got fired. That morning I was so tired I didn’t make the beds properly; I just sat there on the perfect white linen eating chocolates that were meant to be for the guests.</p>

<p>Thinking of him.</p>

<p>I bet he forgot about me, but I remembered him all summer.</p>

<p>Who else, what else? I’m not going to titillate with detail here. This keyboard is way too real and I must email this to a stranger tonight just so you can read it whenever, but… Isn’t it true? The ones you barely get to know are always the most gorgeous. Even better, they stay that way because you’re never around long enough to see them change.</p>

<p>But have you ever really wanted to delete a fuck? I’m sure I’ve deleted a few: name, place, the lot. All the same I can only remember a single time when I told the guy straight afterwards: that really didn’t happen for me.</p>

<p>He was a bit of a slapper really, a rich kid playboy with overdeveloped muscles and an MP dad. No, that sounds awful, he wasn’t as bad as all that. And to be fair he never mentioned his dad, someone else told me that later.
<br>No, he was just this fake superclean skinhead with ironed jeans, an even white smile, nice eyes, the obligatory facial piercings. He was a regular at the bar where I worked, and every time he came in we’d chat a little. He was amusing but not my type, and besides I was living with my big-ego photographer boyfriend. But I was beginning to get bored, so one day when the boyfriend was on a photo shoot, I said okay.</p>

<p>Incredibly, when we went back to his it turned out that the skinhead still lived with his folks, at the age of twenty-four. I guess if he had moved out the shock to his bank balance would have been too much.</p>

<p>We tiptoed to the upper layers of their deluxe city-centre apartment and he mixed himself this gruesome protein drink with a raw egg, then showed me his weightlifting routine. This was funny, but not as funny as the sex. He was strong on weird positions, and he wanted to work through them all. He was really trying hard and I felt bad for not being more appreciative, but the sound effects were too much: I just could not get into it because he kept making these little Mmf Mmf noises, like earlier when he’d been doing his press-ups.</p>

<p>So afterwards I said, ‘You know, that didn’t really count because I didn’t feel it. For me it’s like we never did it.’</p>

<p>I hadn’t thought he’d mind, but he seemed really dishonoured. Didn’t want to be ranked any lower than the top score, much less disqualified at the starting line.</p>

<p>Kept saying, ‘But we did it. Course we did.’</p>

<p>Delete.</p>

<p>Then there’s Control Z. Control Z is what you need for the times you wish had never happened. The times that feel so weirdly good right from the start. Feeling that good is like hurtling into a tunnel blind, never knowing if you’ll crash into a rock face or tumble into a black hole. I guess somebody has to jump into a void if you’re to remember each other at all.</p>

<p>Like the boy who tried so hard to live on the edge that he fell off of it. The poor boy from Brixton who was really a rich boy from Surrey, and he said, ‘Yeah, that’s where I first got into smack — everybody’s on something out there in the ’burbs.’</p>

<p>Like it was new. Well, it was new, to him.</p>

<p>I met him one Friday night at a pub I’d gone to with the folks from the new swanky office job I’d wangled, where if you dressed and acted and spoke posh you could earn twice the money. The pinstripe and heels act I could handle as long as we were at the office, but after two weeks of pretending it was tough to keep it up at the pub as well. I’d have been out of there in five minutes if I hadn’t seen him looking my way.</p>

<p>And he was so beautiful.</p>

<p>That drug-eaten beauty when your face is disappearing, your bones melting behind too pale skin because you never sleep and you never eat. Later, when we climbed out over the railings of Soho Square at two in the morning, he was going south and me east, but he kept walking with me and asking me, asking me, until at last I gave in. A taxi from Smithfield took us out somewhere past Brixton to the cold, cavernous house that he shared with a couple who were already fast asleep.</p>

<p>We went straight to his room. Black painted walls and mattress on the floor, books on the shelf he might have ordered identikit from Rebel Superstore.com — the Kerouac, the Burroughs, all that. Like walking into the past. The only futuristic thing was the tongue movement. I remember thinking, Boys are finally getting good at this stuff, maybe I was born in the wrong generation.</p>

<p>And guess what, maybe Jude was right, because this boy believed in Romance bigtime. I mean, next day he walked to the Tube with me and I kept having to unpeel his arm from round my shoulder. If I was in that dark room with him again I would spend all night listening to his stories, and I would tell him gently that he deserved Romance but mine was all used up. That he should fall somewhere else, with someone else.</p>
