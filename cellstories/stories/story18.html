<h2>Common Enemy</h2>

		</p><p>Detective Locklin tapped his pencil on the edge of the coffee table and slumped back into the couch, waiting for the old man to return from the kitchen. Scanning a bookshelf his eyes rested upon a vase above the stone hearth holding a bunch of wilted daisies. The old man returned with a pot of tea and two mugs.    </p>

<p>"Sorry, my kettle doesn't have a whistle. I've got to watch it or it'll boil down to nothing before you know it." He sat down opposite the detective. "I brought you a mug--in case you change your mind."    </p>

<p>"So Mr. Carlson, what can you tell me about your neighbor here: Mr.--" He flipped back a page.    </p>

<p>"Mandler. To tell the truth, detective, I didn't even know his first name. He was a queer sonofabitch, that's for sure. Never said much, not too friendly. I only knew his name because sometimes I meet the mailman out at the road." He thumbed toward the front door. "He'd ask if I'd seen old Mandler because his mail would pile up now and again. I did see him at the market once, said 'hi.' And he ignored me. All canned goods--like he was stocking an old bomb shelter or something."    </p>

<p>"And the stable?" Locklin asked, writing the name on his pad, tracing over the letters and underlining three times.    </p>

<p>"Now, at one point I was expecting a fight over that." He slid to the edge of the chair and poured himself the tea. "It's steeped long enough. You sure you don't want some?"    </p>

<p>"Thanks, no. You were about to mention--"    </p>

<p>"Oh right-right, the little stable. See, when we moved in we put an addition onto our house, oh, five years ago now. Added the bedroom on the ground floor so we didn't have to climb the stairs. Originally she only had a thousand square feet." He admired the room. "So when the contractor dug the foundation he hit an underground spring. To keep my cellar from flooding I had them build a drainage channel to divert the water back through the hedge, toward the property line." He sipped his tea and said, "it's the common enemy, you know."    </p>

<p>"Sorry?" Locklin looked up from his notebook.    </p>

<p>"The common enemy--that's what my attorney said about standing water. Once it's out of the ground I'm fully within my rights to eliminate it," he said, frowning. "I figured if ol' Mandler cared about that goddamn stable he'd have torn it down or else fixed-up the collapsed roof. It was charming in a way--the weathered gray of the siding--it used to remind me of an abandoned farmhouse from my childhood. Not anymore."    </p>

<p>"But he never noticed or complained about the water, or damp soil or anything?"    </p>

<p>"He said nothing. As far as I knew that stable was abandoned. So I said nothing. Really, I never gave it another thought until this morning."    </p>

<p>"Then what made you call us?"    </p>

<p>"Why, the sycamore. See, my knees felt pretty good this morning, so I decided to get out of the house. I was out walking behind the hedge and I saw a tree had grown up and pierced right through the roof of that old stable. And by the look of it, had some time ago--hell, it's probably been growing since the day it found my runoff. There's a broken window facing south and half the roof is gone, so it must've had enough sunshine. Honestly, I never noticed the tree before today. Never had a reason to."    </p>

<p>Locklin tapped his pencil again. "But a tree growing in an abandoned building: there's really nothing too odd about that..."    </p>

<p>"Look around, detective," Mr. Carlson laughed. "There's not a sycamore within ten miles of here, so I don't think it just happened to grow there. Someone had to have planted it. Those great big leaves sticking through the roof piqued my curiosity. I'm retired, and my wife and I lost our health some years back. Evelyn passed a year ago now.    </p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sir."    </p>

<p>"Thank you." He squeezed his knees. "My point is, detective, that it doesn't take much to draw my interest these days. But as you know, it wasn't just the tree that caught my eye." He pulled a pair of glasses from his breast pocket and put them on, letting the bridge slide down his nose. On the corner of the coffee table he unwrapped a blue handkerchief. Tucked in a crease down the center lay three bones as delicate as the handle of a porcelain teacup--possibly a child's finger.    </p>

<p>"My sight is going, but even at first glance, these seemed out of place--a little too white to be rocks from around here. They're so small; sad." He removed his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose, looking as if he might cry. "On my way back to the house to call you I just kept hoping they belonged to an animal of sorts, but in my gut I knew."    </p>

<p>"Where exactly did you find them? Some distance from the stable then?"    </p>

<p>"That's the thing, see--I found them on the ground near the back of the stable. The tree trunk had cracked right through the clapboards there. I suppose this was brought up by the roots, as the tree grew."    </p>

<p>"So, you were trespassing?"    </p>

<p>"Well--"    </p>

<p>Locklin pulled the handkerchief across the table. He realigned the bones with the eraser-end of his pencil. Carefully folding the handkerchief, he placed it in an envelope, then moved it to his inside pocket. He looked up, as if to ask a question.    </p>

<p>"No, no. I didn't touch it. I've seen enough TV over the years. I picked it up with the handkerchief." He leaned forward and said with sudden fear, "but, uh--Mandler, is he--"    </p>

<p>"In custody. We brought him in for questioning this morning. This should be enough for an arrest, so no need to worry."    </p>

<p>The screen door squeaked open and a young man in a brown suit walked though. "Sir," he nodded to Mr. Carlson, then turned to Locklin, "when you're ready, we've dug in the stable and found more remains."</p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>The dirt road rose and fell across the pastures. They followed the coroner's van at a distance to avoid the dust it kicked up. Piles of clouds replaced the sky, and the afternoon turned cool.    </p>

<p>"I can't imagine what it'd be like," said Locklin's partner, "losing a child like this. Six years she's been missing--what makes you so sure this is your old case? We won't have DNA back for some time." The coroner's van stopped, its right blinker flashing.    </p>

<p>"I dunno. It's just something her mother said when I interviewed her, years ago." He brought the car to a stop and turned right onto the highway. The tires gave a spin in the gravel before they caught the pavement. "A story she told that stuck with me. She broke down one day when it was clear Ashley had been taken--started crying about the laundry. Telling me about her memory of her daughter's clothes -- their earthy smell." Locklin pulled into the left lane and passed the coroner's van, then slowed to match its speed as though escorting it home.    </p>

<p>"She used to love doing the laundry. After Ashley went missing she couldn't wash clothes for weeks. She just sat on the floor in the garage for hours--smelling all the places Ashley had gone in a day on her dirty clothes: the neighborhood; the quiet, tree-lined streets; the sidewalks buckled from the tree roots. It was like she could smell the air as Ashley rode her bike along trying to jump over the cracks."    </p>

<p>Locklin continued, as though in a daze. "The kid rode her bike all around the neighborhood, searching for ingredients. With all the things she gathered she'd make magic potions--adding mud and spider webs and daisies to a bowl and stirring them up. Then she'd bring it to the kitchen and ask her mother to drink it for protection--so they could live forever. After this, when she washed Ashley's mud-covered pants, she learned to always check the pockets. She cried and I pulled my chair next to hers and she cried into my shoulder. She told me how she would get so mad when she emptied Ashley's pockets, stuffed with the potion's secret ingredient: matted balls of camel hair--you know--handfuls of fuzzy, sycamore seeds."    </p>

<p>"Honest? You really believe that--a seed fell from the kid's pocket."    </p>

<p>"I've got to..." he hesitated, "her mother calls me crying, almost every week." A drizzle coated the window, and the detective flipped on the wipers. The rubber blades skidded, struggling to drag the water away.     </p>
