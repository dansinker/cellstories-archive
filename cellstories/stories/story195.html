		</p><p>Some words about the nocturnal sand shrew:  a full-grown male was small enough to fit in your palm, and weighed about as much as an empty Coca-Cola can. It was fanged. To Dr. Ruth Dennis’ surprise, people even managed to find them cute — because of that nose twitch, or the quick wiggling walk, or perhaps because if you flipped one onto its back it would just lie there, blinking, unsure of how to right itself. They had all the supposedly-endearing qualities — big eyes, tiny paws, helpless stupidity — that Americans seemed to approve of in their animals. The only reason that most people knew what the sand shrew even looked like was due to the poster a U.S.-based educational company made featuring one — its huge eyes tilted up, the camera zoomed in on its typical vacant stare, the photo captioned in fat yellow letters: Who Me?.  Two million of these posters had been printed and distributed to classrooms nationwide in 1995. Incidentally, 1995 was also the year the estimated nocturnal sand shrew population dipped below eight hundred. </p>

<p>The Who Me?, Dr. Dennis supposed, referred to the sand shrew’s air of vapid innocence: nothing with eyes that big and a nose that small could be capable of treachery, people assumed. But Dr. Dennis knew them better, at least on paper — knew how their heart rates elevated under threat; knew the precise nutritional value of the sand shrub and the darting beetle; knew that, in labs, sand shrews slept 19 hours a day, let their claws grow, came out angry as babies and just got slower and meaner as they aged. They were notoriously sulky in captivity, elusive in the wild, and vicious in the way that only a small thing could be.  Unfortunately, Dr. Dennis had a knack for teasing them out of their burrows.  “Something sympathetic in your nature, perhaps,” her thesis advisor had mused once. She certainly hoped not.  </p>

<p>But the money these days was in field research, so she was spending this semester encamped in the desert with a Land Rover’s worth of eager graduate students:  all of them up at six every morning for a gritty Nescafe, then out to the survey site to study the previous night’s movements from the central burrow by tracking the prints the sand shrews left in the soft sand. The graduate students were young, confusing, full of pep. At first, Dr. Dennis had felt obligated to chat with them over afternoon tea, but her attempts only made everyone uncomfortable. Somehow back in Madison, she’d managed to miss the moment when they stopped being slightly younger versions of herself and instead turned into an entirely different generation. Their most basic ideas about the world seemed slightly askew. Like what pants were — before this, Dr. Dennis had always thought she had a pretty good grip on that. But these graduate students had a more complicated understanding — they had pants that could unzip and turn into shorts; pants that could, through some marvel of physics, fold up to be stored in their own pockets; pants that never got wet, no matter how hard you might try. </p>

<p>In the hours between dinner and sleep, alone in her tent with her lantern casting ghosty shadows, after her reports had been logged and filed, Dr. Dennis thought of stupid things, like: did they disapprove of her pants? She had always been pleased with her functional life, its neat divisions between work and home, the way the sand shrew never intruded on her dreams. But being looked at with daily pity by the graduate students was starting to make her wonder whether she’d been doing something wrong all along.  </p>

<p>The graduate students attacked their research as if they had nothing to go home to, as if the sand shrew itself would be the thing to unlock the secret of the universe for them, or at least make them rich with NSF funding.  She was particularly baffled by Louisa, a freckled third year in applied linguistics, who had rigged up a recording device that she left outside the burrow every night; she spent hours crouched in the study tent, searching for patterns in the squeaks.  </p>

<p>What were they doing, any of them? Five weeks in, they had enough data for everyone’s dissertations, for a number of journal papers. But the money was for a ten-week study so they stayed, eating hummus and chicken every night for dinner, dutifully tracking the pawprints that never varied. They were scientists, so their stir craziness manifested itself in even more precise regression analysis, or in Louisa’s tentmate, Charles’ sudden interest in weighing everything he could get his hands on:  piles of sand, old socks, the skulls of dead sand shrews. Some of the others appeared to be sleeping with each other, or maybe just attempting to — there were suddenly wide, significant silences over dinner. Mostly, though, Dr. Dennis kept to her tent, and considered the sand shrew.  </p>

<p>As a species, she conceded that they were fussy and unappealing with absurd dietary and habitat needs for a terrestrial mammal; yet she was growing into a grudging respect for how doggedly they seemed bent on extinction. As a childless only child, she supposed she sympathized; the sand shrew was after something more nuanced and harder to achieve than mere reproduction.</p>

<p>Not that these ideas were anything she’d tell anyone, ever. They were tent thoughts; they came from the desert, she suspected, and she was planning on leaving them there when the study wrapped up and she returned to her office, her apartment, her spare and lovely life. </p>

<p>Then one week later, someone finally caught a live one. It was against policy, since the sand shrew’s nervous system was so delicately balanced that the stress of being trapped usually killed a captive within a few hours, but everyone was excited to see it nonetheless. Charles had found it, he said, slinking back to the burrow in the early afternoon. That seemed unlikely, but even Dr. Dennis was too curious to ask many questions.  </p>

<p>It was a full-grown female, and Charles had a finger pressed to the back of her neck so she couldn’t squirm out of his hand. She was furiously expelling tiny pellets of shit in his palm, while Charles smiled benignly. He had red hair, and Dr. Dennis for the first time noted his nearly translucent eyelashes, or maybe it was that did not have eyelashes at all. “Got one,” he said mildly. “She’s not happy about it, though.” Louisa stood next to Charles, her face transformed. She pulled a tiny tape recorder from an invisible pocket somewhere inside the cuff of her pants. Charles pressed hard enough that the sand shrew was flattened against his hand. She was bleating and baring her teeth. “Nice examples of the distress calls, Louisa,” Charles said. “Probably the clearest on record to date.” </p>

<p>In retrospect, that was what changed everything. It was only two days later that Louisa said over breakfast, “I think something is happening with the burrow.” Dr. Dennis looked at her. It was hard to give Louisa and her chipmunk cheeks much credit, and besides, there was her alliance with Charles, who, Dr. Dennis suddenly realized, she did not like or trust at all. “There’s a particular chirping series they just started to do that I’ve never heard before,” Louisa went on. “It’s not distress and it’s not feeding and it’s not mating. They’re agitated and I don’t know why.” “Okay, Louisa,” Dr. Dennis said. “Type up the report.”  </p>

<p>That night the wind was so strong that Dr. Dennis tucked her head inside her sleeping bag and slept with her face against the polyester shell, smothered by the smell of her own expelled breaths. She awoke disoriented, without any memory of having fallen asleep. That day, activity around the burrow seemed muted; they could find only the faintest traces of tiny splay-toed feet. A consequence of the windstorm, everyone assumed, though Dr. Dennis felt uneasy for reasons she could not explain.  </p>

<p>For the next three nights there was no wind at all, and still the tracks around the burrow got so faint that eventually none of the grad students could spot them. “The wind storm must’ve caused them to change burrows,” Louisa theorized. “Or maybe they’ve caught a disease.” But no one had found any of the telltale sand mounds that signaled an abandoned nest; instead, Dr. Dennis noted the nibbled-off tips of thorns indicating that the feeding ground, at least, was still in use.  </p>

<p>On the fourth day after he wind storm, Dr. Dennis knelt on the ground by the burrow’s main entrance. She searched the sand and saw nothing. Her heart fell with unexpected violence. “No visible evidence,” she said calmly, and someone duly took down notes.  She lay down on the ground, pressing her cheek to the sand and looked at the burrow. It was early, and the ground was still cool against her face. She watched the graduate students shift uneasily in their shoes, unsure of whether they should be offering to help her up. And then she saw the thing — well, it was barely anything, really, just the slightest disruption of the sand’s surface. She squinted harder. A ghost of a pawprint. “Do you see anything?” Charles asked. Was it crazy to say that she heard a greediness in his voice? “No,” she said. “Wherever they are, they’re not here.” 
<br>That night the whole research team convened in the study tent. It was another windless evening, and their voices seemed amplified by the still air. They all knew that finding this burrow had been a piece of wild luck; there was no way they’d have enough time to locate another. Dr. Dennis tried to sound confident and in control, but she was distracted by Charles and Louisa whispering together in a corner. “I can’t believe that they’ve gone away,” she heard Louisa wail like a child.  </p>

<p>But Dr. Dennis knew that they hadn’t gone away, or not exactly. She had felt it first as a feeling, and then as something more sure than that. That night in her tent, she had an experience that she wouldn’t dare repeat to anyone else. She had a — well, she supposed you would have to call it a vision. What she saw was the desert basin overrun with the nocturnal sand shrew, whole wriggling swarms of them, but they looked unknowable and strange, almost transparent, and she had the sudden idea that it was not that the animals were abandoning the burrow by finding another, but that they were somehow getting lighter, making less of an impression on the world. </p>

<p>The next morning she snuck out before breakfast and trekked alone to the study site. The burrow was sloppy with human footprints and not much else. She squatted down by the burrow and waited for a full five minutes, but the whole time the errand felt foolish — what had she even expected to see? But on the way back to the camp, a movement caught her eye. She turned very slowly and it was there, just as if it always had been:  a sand shrew, on the smaller side, busily wiggling its way back toward the burrow. She was so shocked to see it in the daytime that it took a moment to register that she could see the sand through it — as thought it was there, but not completely. It was like a 75 percent grayscale version of itself. An animal fading back into impossibility, perhaps where it had always belonged. </p>

<p>Dr. Dennis watched until the strange sand shrew slipped into the burrow, and she knew she would never see a live one in the wild again. It was not a sad thought. She stayed there, though, crouched in the sand, and tried not to think anything. And then when the sun was up enough to scald her bare neck, she stood to walk home.  Now she could creep back into her sleeping bag now and sleep as late as she wanted. Maybe, if she was lucky, something in her biology might react with the desert air. Maybe in the morning she wouldn’t wake up as whole and solid as always.</p>
