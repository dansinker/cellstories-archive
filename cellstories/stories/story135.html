<h2>This Odd Present</h2>
	<h3>Christine Maul Rice</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p> As soon as I stepped off the elevator, piercing, wounded-animal wails sent my head swimming.  And, then, as usual, the insults began.  Someone in his hospital room, apparently, was a <i>fat S.O.B</i>.  Even hoarse with fury, there was no mistaking dad’s voice and the insult du jour.  Everyone from the tiny Filipino nurse to the buff intern became a <i>fat SOB</i>.  I had to hand it to him.  Even now, in full-blown demented rage, he’d packed an arsenal of insult, insinuation and shame into two little words. </p>

<p>      The wails began, again, and ricocheted toward me.  I tried stepping back into the elevator but it closed as if to say, <i>Get in there, bitch, and face it</i>.  Taking a few uncertain steps away from the sound, I finally stopped in front of a miserably pale landscape of Dutch children pulling nets from the sea.  When the insults resumed, my eyes ticked toward the door and caught the glance of a beefy, no-nonsense nurse hustling out.  She squinted at me as if she knew I was the spawn Crazy Man in Bed B. </p>

<p>      I found my imaginary balls, walked into Room 214, passed Mr. Moriarty in Bed A and tugged the peach curtain. Sturdy canvas straps restrained dad’s wrists.  Bruises, crimson and tumoral, bloomed under his delicate, old man’s skin.  The blotches and restraints prompted a sickening, powerless feeling that nearly buckled my knees.</p>

<p>      “God-damn Nazis.  God-damn S.O.Bs!”</p>

<p>      Partially hidden behind the curtain, a nurse’s aid sat slumped in a lounge chair.  He patted Dad’s upper arm, “Been like this since I came in this morning, right Mr. Maul?”</p>

<p>      Dad’s head rolled from side to side.  Crescent moons of spit punctuated the corners of his mouth.  I walked to the other side of his bed, picked up a clean washcloth and tried dabbing perspiration off his forehead.  Jaw taught, pupils dilated, eyes murderous, he arched his back and pressed his head against the mattress in a fruitless effort to free himself.  Wired disks dotted his chest and sent monotonous reports to blinking green monitors.  Catheter tubes carried pale yellow liquid to unknown locations and his long white legs stuck out from the bedclothes. Blood-soaked bandages lay in a heap next to his thigh.  All his thrashing had exposed the stitched, bloody incision of his hip replacement.  I tugged the sheet to cover his blue plastic diaper.  He didn’t seem to recognize me and spoke with such rage that his lips barely moved, “This sonofabitch has tied me down.”</p>

<p>      I tried wedging my fingers between his left wrist and the strap but it was too tight. “Can you take off the straps or loosen them at least?” Tell you the truth, I wasn’t sure I wanted the straps off. He scared me when he was like this.  I had rarely seen this side of him but had heard stories, from his nine brothers, about his temper and ass-kicking days.  But this was different.  This was full-blown dementia-fueled rage.  At eighty-one, his body was still ox-strong and quick.  That’s why they used those restraints.  I wondered how many of them it took to hold him down.</p>

<p>      “Not until he calms down.”</p>

<p>      “Not until he calms down mah-mah-mah,” Dad bleated the last part like an annoyed lamb.  “Tell that lazy bastard to take them off!  Have you ever seen such fat one?”</p>

<p>      “I’m so sorry,” I began, but the nurse’s aid raised an open palm.  The badge resting on his stomach read <i>Chad</i>.</p>

<p>      “It’s okay.”  Chad seemed to get a kick out of the insults.  He had remarkably brilliant blue eyes and delicate, cupid lips.   “He’s right, you know.  Look at me.  I’m huge.  I’m probably the biggest guy you’ll ever see.  Can’t seem to do a thing about it.”</p>

<p>      “Try eating less.”</p>

<p>      “Dad, please.”</p>

<p>      “Naw.  It’s okay.  Really.”  With absolutely no spite, Chad patted dad’s arm absently and added, “Seriously.  Look at me.  I’m huge--”</p>

<p>      And, as if all this wasn’t enough, he pushed himself out of the chair, walked to the end of the bed and gracefully pivoted on his heel. </p>

<p>      I wanted to turn away, to look out the window at the dazzling morning light playing off branches bent to nearly breaking under a thick coat of ice.  But I just stood there and watched the odd show.  He was, in fact, the biggest man I had ever seen.  His upper arms, under a purple smock, poured off his shoulders in waves of flesh.  His torso strained seams.  The bulk of his legs pooled around his ankles.</p>

<p>        I wanted to deny his girth, apologize and say, really, you aren’t the <i>biggest</i> man I’ve ever seen and my Dad really isn’t the <i>biggest</i> asshole in the world.  I wanted to explain that his dementia funneled into violent outbursts when he felt frustrated or when off his medication.  I wanted to say that he fought in the Battle of the fuckin’ Bulge for god sakes, saw countless buddies fall, cleared out concentration camps, taught me how to throw a sinker and hit a line drive.  I wanted to say something like, ‘He’s usually not like this,’ but the words stuck.  How would I know?  I hadn’t seen him in over 20 years.  He’d left, after all, when I was 17 and wouldn’t take my calls or write and, that just in the last year, his new family called me to care for him when his dementia deepened and became too much to handle.  I wanted to say that I was ashamed of all the years I spent hating him, of his behavior and mine but, of course, how could I?</p>

<p>      The silence became overwhelming; punctuated by only the gentle hum of pumps and machines designed to keep people alive.  The sickening aroma of urine mixed with unwashed flesh and orange antiseptic turned my stomach.  And, just when the silence became overwhelming, a tall, round-faced nurse bounded in.</p>

<p>      “Hello, handsome!”  My Dad and I jumped at her braying voice.  She was annoyingly cheery and I could tell she heightened the act for family members. </p>

<p>      “I’m not deaf,” Dad responded.</p>

<p>      “Well I’ll make a note of that on your chart, Mr. Maul.”  Her frosted hair flipped off her face in a Farrah Faucet wave.  Bright blue eyeshadow.  Only in Flint, I thought.</p>

<p>      Dad swallowed and tried to compose himself.  His lips pressed together and he clenched and unclenched his fists.  They were treating him like a child and he hated it.</p>

<p>      Mr. Moriarty, in Bed A, suddenly perked up, smiled and waved at me.</p>

<p>      “You the gal they sent from Corporate to pick up these Chevy docs?”</p>

<p>      “No, Mr. Moriarty,” Chad answered and winked at me, “they sent that secretary in yesterday.”</p>

<p>      “They did, huh?”  He pulled his glasses off his forehead, chewed vacantly on one end and straightened the stack of newspapers on his bed table. </p>

<p>       It amazed me how these people with dementia could scare up memories from thirty, forty years ago -- perfectly formed, accurate memories of work, home, family -- but their short-term memories were so shredded that they couldn’t place where they were, how they got there, what decade it was. </p>

<p>      The nurse busied herself with the incision, dressed the wound and replaced the bandages.</p>

<p>      “If you take off the restraints I’ll make sure he doesn’t cause any trouble.  I’ll be right here with him.”</p>

<p>      She pursed her lips and peered at me over her glasses, “He <i>acts</i> like a good boy <i>then</i> we take off the restraints.  Not vicey-versy.”</p>

<p>        <i>Vicey-versy</i> switched an irrational, angry switch in my brain.</p>

<p>   “Look.”  I pointed to the bruise on his left wrist and tried keeping my voice even, “This is cruel.”</p>

<p>      The edge of her lip curled.  And right then, I knew I lost the battle.</p>

<p>        “We offer the best and most compassionate care under the circumstances.”  She pronounced, under the circumstances, very slowly like I’d lost my mind, too, and turned to leave. “Those restraints will stay on until I take them off.  Chad, you’re needed in room 218.”</p>

<p>      Chad, who had been stroking dad’s long, elegant foot, shrugged and mouthed, “Sorry.”</p>

<p>      “I’m sorry, too, about the--”</p>

<p>      But he waved me off again.  “Happens all the time.  No worries.”</p>

<p>      After he left, I leaned in to kiss dad’s forehead.</p>

<p>      “Chrissie?”  His eyes focused on me and his voice softened, the words rounded and warm as if all the fight in him had evaporated.  “When did you get here, honey?”</p>

<p>      “I’ve been here, Dad.”</p>

<p>      “You have?  You should have said something.”</p>

<p>      I wrapped his left hand in both of mine.  Blood stained the canvas in the shape of a cloud, just above the bones of his wrist.  I noticed, not for the first time, how similar our hands were:  long fingers, prominent knuckles, the skin scarred and nicked from, for him, years of battles huge and small.</p>

<p>      “My God, honey, your hands are like ice.  Put them under my armpits.”  He tried lifting his arms but the restraints stopped him abruptly.</p>

<p>      He looked down, surprised, “They’ve got me strapped down.”</p>

<p>      “I know, Dad.”</p>

<p>      “Can you do something about that?”</p>

<p>      What the hell, I thought, reaching under the bed to loosen the straps.</p>

<p>      He pulled his hands from the loops and rubbed each wrist gingerly.  Then he took my hands and put them under his armpit. </p>

<p>      My hands, between his chest and upper arm, began to warm.  I leaned so close to him that I could see the individual grey whiskers sprouting out of the bright strawberry birthmark mark below his high cheekbone and smell the coffee from his breakfast.  His breathing had quieted and, as I stood there, my hands in his armpit, thinking that I needed to comb his hair, listening to the capable, monotonous thrum of pumps, the tings of monitors, I tried to think of something to say.  All of our conversations hung, precariously, on the delicate hook of a shared past.  The years fell into categories of <i>What we could talk about</i> and <i>What we could not talk about</i>.  I couldn’t bring up the other woman or the divorce or his new family or his brutal surgery of me from his life.  But, sometimes, those were the only things I could remember.</p>

<p>      For a number of years after my first daughter was born, I tried calling him.  That <i>woman</i>, the one he left mom for, would answer.  Heart pounding, I’d ask to speak to my dad.  And every time, that bitch would ask, ‘Who’s calling?’  As if I wasn’t his only child.  As if she’d forgotten he had a kid.  And here’s what I wanted to say:  Just get my Dad on the phone you whore, you slut, you home-wrecker.  Instead, always polite, I’d answer, <i>It’s his daughter</i>.  And when she still didn’t respond, I’d close my eyes, and finish, <i>It’s his daughter, Chris</i>.  Then and only then, would she set down the phone to find him.</p>

<p>      He’d sound amazed that I’d called, ‘Chrissie, well, hello, honey.  How are you?”  He’d have come in from the garden, I guessed, the knees of his jeans stained black, fingernails dark with dirt.  And she would be just a few feet away, at the sink, maybe, washing dishes, standing guard, making sure she heard every word.  Before I could answer, he’d ask, anxiously, “Can I call you later?  I was just on my way out.” </p>

<p>      I wanted to tell him I wouldn’t keep him, that I just wanted to say hi, tell him about his granddaughter.  Instead, I’d answer, “Yeah.  I guess.’  Knowing full well he’d never call. </p>

<p>      Palming the grey stubble of his chin, he jolted me from my reverie, “I need a shave.  Look like a goddamn hippie.  Say, how are you, honey?  How’s my lawyer?”</p>

<p>      I pulled my hands away found a comb and pulled it through his silver hair, “I’m not a lawyer, Dad.  I’m a writer and I teach.”</p>

<p>      “Oh.”</p>

<p>      “I’m married, we have two girls, your granddaughters.  Remember?”</p>

<p>      But he couldn’t remember.  He had no way to frame the details of my life since he’d become sick.  I’d been trapped in his memory, in a tamper-proof box, preserved in my late-teens, early twenties for a long time.</p>

<p>      That imaginary box loomed between us so that, when we were together like this, alone and without words, the hurt threatening to bury me, I would scramble to find some common ground, a memory, from when he was still my dad.</p>

<p>      “Dad?”</p>

<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>“Remember how we used to send messages up the string of a kite?”</p>

<p>      When I was a kid, I’d write corny notes in crayon.  Stuff like, <i>March 4, 1970. If you find this, you will have 5 years good luck from above date, or, If you find this, it came from Chrissie Maul, third grade at Indian Hill School Grand Blanc Michigan and you are a rock star!</i>  We’d fold the message neatly, put it in a brown paper lunch bag, puncture the folded edge of the bag with a silver paperclip and hook it over a quivering kite string.  It would sail up the string, magically, until, nearing the kite’s fluttering tail, we’d snap the taut string and send it hurtling toward earth.</p>

<p>      He nodded, smiling, “I remember that.”  He looked out the window, past me, into the dazzling blue sky, “I loved you so much when you were a kid.”</p>

<p>      “I loved you when I was a kid, too.”</p>

<p>      I wondered if that was enough:  knowing that he loved me, all those years ago, when I was a kid.</p>

<p>      The rest, this odd present, I’d have to figure out as we went along.</p>
