		</p><p><i>Oh hey look at that</i> </p>

<p>      I wrote you a note and put it on your windshield. Everything for blocks and blocks was catching light and I knew you wouldn’t be able to drive away without losing a tire but I thought it was something I should do. A keepsake. That’s not the right word. You could burn it or frame it or something, I don’t know. On the front it says I’m Sorry and then there’s this big crosshatched box where I wrote About Your Prom then scratched it out. It’s not funny. Sirens. Don’t look. </p>

<p><i>Zoetropes, is that what they’re called? Am I thinking of flipbooks? Those things with the tiny little pictures going round and around, little still things pretending to be fast things, freeze-frame, like picture picture picture makes a whole</i> </p>

<p>      I didn’t tell you where I was going but you still found me, which is kind of impressive, I guess. We’re in the train station now, together, because hoping for something is never enough. I keep crossing my legs but when I do all the stupid chiffon of my on-purpose-ugly hot pink ‘80s dress ruffles and rustles and you look at me weird, like what?, so I’m never going to cross my legs again ever. You’re holding this bright green glass bottle, cute before, stupid now. On the back of the note on your windshield I wrote You Don’t Deserve This in invisible ink. I meant it, but still. I was hoping you wouldn’t follow me here.</p>

<p>      Where are we going to go? I ask, and you make this stupid squinting face like I’m thinking about it. You crack your knuckles against your chin, one by one, slowly and I want to cross my legs so bad it almost hurts.  </p>

<p><i>thing There are all of these, anyway, everybody should get this once except I guess maybe differently, hey I can see straight into the Toronto Star building, look at that, there’s one guy on the twentieth floor, sweeping, still, picture picture picture. There’s this really gruesome ad campaign, you see it on subways, street corners, some group’s trying to get people to turn their lights off at night so that birds won’t fly into everyone’s windows and fall, it’s all these really gory pictures of mangled birds bleeding their bright red blood onto the sidewalk. I guess people who work in office buildings have cars so </i></p>

<p>      There are a lot of reasons I wasn’t your prom date. Caroline is skinny and quiet and more your type. She likes stories about football. She likes watching you talk. She likes watching things, really – just looking. That was why she liked me. I provided. She gets sadder when she’s drunk, she doesn’t make fun of anything. She spent $200 on a real dress.</p>

<p>      You crack your knuckles. I cross my legs. Everything in here echoes. 
<br> 
<br><i>Realistically, when you think about the structure of things I mean when you wake up and you get that weird rush of feeling like Today, something impossible is going to happen to me you think of it in terms that are really realistically pretty miniscule if you think about it really. Like I don’t know, you think I am going to d</i>   
<br>     
<br> The glass floor in the CN tower isn’t scary, just like finishing high school isn’t. They’ve made glass that can last through nuclear wars and we’re all headed towards bright, promising futures. There are canapés and that rotating restaurant and you can take a long pull on a bottle that’s materialized from somewhere and watch the world spin all around you. The glass floor can hold the weight of eight hundred elephants; this is definitely true because there are plaques on the wall that say it, so you should be able to lie down and watch the whole city running itself. When your date comes by and makes some stupid joke about how literally everyone can see up your dress you can smile a little and take his hand and kiss him and feel safe. There’s nothing here that’s scary.  </p>

<p><i>sorry about that okay like you think I am maybe going to get a really good mark on this test or go to Value Village and watch my best friend shoplift, today I am going to let Scott Plant put his hand up my skirt in the parking lot, there’s nothing that’s expectable </i></p>

<p>      I didn’t see it, but I heard. Everyone did, probably the whole city – when you’re that high up, stuff echoes, right? This awful, enormous sound like everything falling apart all at once, and then I decided. There are one thousand, seven hundred and seventy-six steps between you and your future, if you can trip down them in heels hearing the world going crack crash crack all around you. I wrote a note and stuck it on the windshield of your car and when I looked around me everything was covered in these little tiny silver shards, catching all the red and blue. Glass reflects light, not sound, but I heard high pitch and cracking, this woman going Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck and there was more red, so I hurried. I felt a tiny crunch under my feet so I stomped a little, but nothing broke. Of course. They’ve made glass that can last through nuclear wars. Nobody is ever going to be able to tell us how this happened. Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck. </p>

<p><i>I can see straight into every single room in every single tower, All empty. Makes me feel oh shit hang on sorry  </i></p>

<p>      Toronto at twilight looks like a box of unstruck matches. There’s potential, all these office towers with the lights on and nobody in them. Police cars and ambulances just waiting for a chance to light up. From the glass floor in the CN tower you can look down and see architecture, no people. Perfect. Your prom date, full of canapés and Jameson’s, can roll onto her stomach, press her nose up against the glass and trace the outline of the city with her tongue. She can say, slowly, that she likes the Skydome and when I say Nobody likes the Skydome you, standing on the periphery, can give me the same look you’re giving me now, like I’m ruining something. I can get up and walk away and miss everything. </p>

<p><i>because sometimes right sometimes you spend fifteen minutes leaning against some teacher’s Volvo pretending to smoke two cigarettes and when he does show up he just kisses you on the mouth, nicely, once, and asks you to go with him, you can’t ever know things is the thing that I’m saying I’m learning like tonight I found out I like drinking, it makes the tips of my fingers feel prickly and by the way should I be colder than this? It feels like I should be oh fuck one second I just can I </i></p>

<p>      We’re going to be in newspapers, you and I. She will, anyway, and I think we’ll feel responsible. I figure this out and it’s so startling that I stand up and grab your hand and pull. You’re sweaty. I walk us in the direction of the ticket booth, and because Union station has this huge cathedral ceiling we sound like an orchestra – me with my stupid dress rustling loud and awkward and you with the bottle going clink clink clink against your belt buckle. We are covered in glass. You crack your knuckles again. Percussion.  
<br> 
<br><i>Scott Plant and his hands and now I am wishing I’d spent less instead of just watching okay just one second okay just one the birds flying and the impossible dark shine of it, the concrete and the gray and the streetlights all blooming into themselves, waiting for me, all the rooms in every office and this sound suddenly this symphony orchestra hiss and crack I didn’t fly into anything so why do I deserve to end up like this, the sound of what’s waiting for me landing again and again with this no one second just wait please hang on if I close my eyes I can see the pictures every room in every office if I </i></p>

<p>      There’s one woman in the ticket booth. She looks tired and I want to do something, like hug her or trade places, maybe. She asks us where we want to go, and you don’t look sad but you don’t say anything either. So I tell her. </p>

<p><i>Oh.</i></p>
