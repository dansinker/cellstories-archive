<h2>Push Kick Coast</h2>

<p>I was never a good skater but I’d push kick coast for the ladies in the USA—The United Skates of America. During the last days of Roller Disco, 1980, I was a man of fifteen. Well, not yet men, but Stacy Wynn and Herman Knight could legally drive and Greg and I were only a summer away from learner’s permits. Oh, And what a summer it promised to be—no day camp, no summer school, no vacation bible school; my little sister was staying with our grandparents for the summer. My brothers were both in the military and my single mother’s work schedule made my curfew impossible to enforce. The world was my oyster and the United Skates of America was my oyster bed.</p>

<p>The old USA was the place where teenage romance was born. From the outside, it looked like a brick airplane hanger. The bulk of the inside was a wooden roller rink crammed into one corner. In the opposite corner was the refreshment area, complete with year old hot dogs rolling under a heat lamp. Right next to the food was the skate rental. That made it easy for the same employee to go straight from handing out skates to slapping a dog on a bun for you. (which, when I was 15, never struck me as disgusting) Between the rink and refreshments was a carpeted area with benches that looked like someone cut those giant wire spools in half, nailed them to the floor and put shag carpeting on them. They were random colors, red, orange, yellow, but the floor had a brown, short napped carpet. The area looked like a psychedelic mushroom garden.</p>

<p>With one skate atop a mushroom cap, I struck a pose of contrived casualness that only looks cool department store catalogue photographers. Wearing my favorite polyester shirt with a pattern of realistic sunset views from the dock o’ the bay and my Jordache jeans, I was feeling good.  Convinced of my own manliness because I was already 6 feet tall, my baby face and irrepressible smile told the world I was still a kid. Looking cool, I shared my pack of Rollos with one of the two cute girls from Cleveland Hts. that Stacy Wynn and I had just met.</p>

<p>My man Stacy Wynn. He was a year older than me and ten years cooler, definitely the coolest dude in our four man crew. At 5’11”, Stacy was an inch shorter than me, but if you took our afros into consideration, he was nearly an inch taller. He is the only guy I have ever met with the named Stacy. Stacy didn’t care that he had a girls’ name, he said “it helps me relate to women better.” He was cool like that. He was the first kid I ever met who seemed truly comfortable with himself. Out of the four of us, he was the biggest ladies’ man, too, and he was always trying to help you upgrade you skills. He had great advice for a 16 year old. I remember him warning me about trying to be funny all the time by saying, “Ric, you’re so light-skinned and pretty, girls love you, ‘til you open up your mouth. Girls like to see you have a serious side, even if you don’t.”  He had acne free brown skin and a wide easy smile that made you believe everything he said, no matter how outlandish.</p>

<p>Stacy asked the Cleveland Hts. cuties, “Have you seen my man Ric here on Days of Our Lives? Yeah, he’s an actor.”</p>

<p>Cutie #2, “Uh, no…”</p>

<p>Rollo eating cutie, “Oh, I thought you looked familiar.”</p>

<p>Stacy, “Yeah, he’s off for the summer ‘cuz we’re working on a movie deal. I’m his agent.” Stacy said stuff like that with such confidence that I almost believed it. It wasn’t so much that Stacy was lying, it was more his sense of humor. He wanted to see how far he could take a joke. You could always count on him to tell the truth when it really mattered like when you needed to wipe your nose or needed a blast of Binaca.</p>

<p>As I offered another Rollo, I spotted Greg Eggleston push kicking toward us. His eyes locked with mine from across the refreshment area and, as usual, he looked serious. Because he was so short he would disappear behind people as he skated. What Greg lacked in height he made up for in width, far from fat, he was a mini Schwartzenegger. Built like a fireplug, we used to say, when he was a baby, his mom gave him twenty pound rattles.</p>

<p>Greg was my oldest friend. I don’t remember a time before knowing Greg. On the street we grew up on, we used to say the Greg had “Gremlin blood,” if he got angry, he got super strong. It was easy to get him to laugh but he never made joke himself, always serious. Greg rolled up beside me and said, “Somebody’s messing with Herman.” Referring to the fourth guy in our set.</p>

<p>We went to investigate. As we push kicked away from Heights Cuties, I heard Stacy behind me saying, “We’re coming back for those numbers, Ladies.” He was smooth like that.</p>

<p>The fact that somebody was messing with Herman was no surprise-- that happened “on the regular.” Herman Knight was 5-6 and about 12 pounds. Most of that weight from his very big mouth. I had known him since he was 8 and he always had a big mouth. He was also the first kid I ever saw talk back to adults. He was a master in the use of quick repartee to humiliate another-- which we dubbed the “Herman burn.”</p>

<p>Push, kick, coast.</p>

<p>When we got to the far end of the mushrooms, a small crowd had already formed hoping there might be a fight. There were two guys menacing Herman, Tre and Vance. Tre, the leader, was one of those guys who looked mad even when he laughed. 17, athletic and nearly six feet tall, made even taller by his candy apple red skates. His sidekick, Vance, was thin and even taller with an enormous ‘Fro. We knew these guys from the USA and they were punks. Greg worked his way past a couple of people so he could stand beside Tre and Vance in case anything went down. Classic Greg, he always had your back. The verbal exchange was half threats, half Herman Burns.</p>

<p>Vance, “you talk to my girl again, Ima bust you up”</p>

<p>Herman, “I don’t talk to Vickie. We just like to exercise lips.”</p>

<p>“You better shut up, you little faggot.”</p>

<p>“If I’m a faggot your girlfriend’s a dude.”</p>

<p>Both Herman and Tre were playing for the crowd using contrasting styles. As usual, Herman was getting laughs. Tre looked around at the cackling crowd. I could see his embarrassment showing as anger. His thick lips narrowed and his brow dropped. He was about to kill Herman. I tried to use a Jedi mind trick to make Herman shut up. Herman repeated to the crowd, “His girlfriend’s a dude!” They laughed.</p>

<p>Tre took a step toward Herman. The growing crowd fell silent. “I am going to kick your little ass.”</p>

<p>“You’re going to kiss my little what?”</p>

<p>“Ass, your little a…” Tre didn’t get to finish his sentence. The howling crowd helped him realize his mistake. There were people clapping or slapping fives or literally, falling down with laughter. Believe me: There is nothing funnier to a teenager than another’s humiliation.</p>

<p>At this point, Tre’s options to save face were limited. Personally, I would have broken off a spate of Yo Momma jokes. First, I would ridicule her weight, then focus on her stupidity and finish off with diatribe on her sluttyness. This technique of deflection was not a part of Tre’s repertoire. Nope. Tre wasn’t a talker, he was a man of action. Tre had to do something and do something, he did.</p>

<p>Using the full force of his sinewy arms, Tre pushed Herman hard. Herman, caught off guard because he was basking in the laughter of the crowd, went down hard, skidding on the carpet enough for a burn. The force of the push caused Tre  to glide backwards on his skates, arms extended to either side of body like a human cross that asks the question, “Watcha gonna do?”</p>

<p>Some kids rolled away from the action but with a push kick Stacy coasted into the middle of it, always the peacemaker. Stacy liked things light. He liked to have fun. This wasn’t fun. Calmly, Stacy said,”re-lax.”</p>

<p>When Stacy coasted in, sidekick Vance tried to roll in, too. But Greg stuck out his foot. Sidekick Vance’s skate didn’t go where he expected, he spun on his other skate. In an effort to maintain his balance, Vance grabbed the closest the closest thing, which happened to be Janice Hall’s enormous left breast. Janice, who was not in skates, yelled “Uh-Uh” and started swinging, beating sidekick Vance to the ground. Hilarious. This brought cheers from the crowd and security into the situation.</p>

<p>Within seconds, Tre’ and Vance were escorted from USA. “I am gonna get you!” Tre yelled with an employee on his arm.</p>

<p>Herman couldn’t resist delivering one more dig, “Well, I’ll be at Amy Joy’s eating a donuts with yo momma!”</p>

<p> “Ooooo!“ went the crowd, except Greg and Stacy. Stacy smacked Herman on the back of his neck and said, “Shut up more often. Damn.” And with a Push Kick Stacy coasted toward a group of girls, slapping Greg five as he passed. With a relieved smile on my face, I turned to the right and ordered a hotdog.</p>

<p>As always, after skating, we drove to Amy Joy’s Donuts in Herman’s big ass Buick Electra 225, a car I named the BoatMobile. All the way there, Herman and I were trading insults the way two kids play catch. Because Herm couldn’t parallel park, we went to the deserted lot out back. As we walked toward donut heaven, Stacy and Herman about twenty feet ahead because Greg and I fell behind taking turns punching each other medium hard in the arm for no apparent reason, when I heard someone ahead of us say, “Hey, hey, you got somethin’ to say now, Pussy?” Unbelievable, it was Tre with a four man posse. They had been waiting, maybe for hours, to ambush us. Of course, I recognized Tre and sidekick Vance but the three others were complete strangers to me. There was an ugly thug, fat thug, and this old dude with squinty eyes who must have been 25.</p>

<p>“W’chew gonna say now, huh?” demanded Tre. Of course, Herman didn’t have anything to say; no crowd, no glory, no point. Stacy didn’t miss a beat, though. He stepped forward with both palms extended and said, “Aww, c’mom now fella’s.” But that was the end of the conversation and time stopped. Time stopped everything but action. Like a planned assault they rushed at us-- Sidekick Vance tackled Herman but the first guy to get to Stacy caught a mouthful of knuckles for his trouble-- Tre, and the fat thug, piled onto Stacy and Greg dove into that pile up headfirst.</p>

<p>Me? I stood frozen in time, stunned, but brought back to the moment when the lightening in my jaw that told me I had just been clocked. I didn’t know see who had struck me, but standing over me was the ugly thug, winding up to kick me, but flying into my field of vision, a blur that roared named Greg Eggleston. He rang that stranger’s bell. Gremlin Blood!</p>

<p>While Greg threw punishing haymakers with a knee on Ugly Thug’s chest, I rushed to help Herm, who was on his belly getting his face pushed into the blacktop with sidekick Vance on his back. I threw my arm around Vance’s and pulled, but angle made the headlock a chokehold so when I pulled harder Vance made a panicked, gravelly sound as he strained for air. As Vance struggled against my grip, Herm was up andanstantly throwing rabbit punches at Vance’s ribs saying, ”What now, bitch?” I released Vance who curled into a ball.</p>

<p>Clop! Over my right shoulder a noise that sounded like, clop, like a percussionist’s wood blocks. A sound so sudden, strange and out of place, everyone froze for a moment. Then, in synch, everyone turned to the source of the sound. My eyes landed on the scene in time to see Stacy collapse making absolutely no attempt to break his own fall, his head clapping the blacktop like the last domino. When Stacy dropped, he revealed that man with the squinty eyes, flared nostrils, twisted smile, in his hands was a wooded ball bat. I knew in a flash what had happened. The sound that I thought had been wood on wood was wood on skull.</p>

<p>Stacy lay motionless. They scattered. We ran to our friend.</p>

<p>“Stacy, Stacy”</p>

<p>“Don’t shake him like that, Herm.” Greg commanded</p>

<p>“Wake up, Stacy, man.”</p>

<p>“What are we going to do!?” I asked</p>

<p>“He’ll be alright” asserted Herman. And why wouldn’t he be?  In our suburban world everything turned out OK, right?</p>

<p>After what seemed like a lifetime, Stacy opened his eyes but didn’t focus or answer questions. I asked, “What year is it?”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” Herman chided.</p>

<p>“I don’t know!!”</p>

<p>Then Greg calmly stated, ”We’re taking him to the hospital”</p>

<p>“No, he’ll be alright. Besides, we’ll get in trouble,” Herman argued, “The Police, your Dad, my parents will kill me .”</p>

<p>This debate went on entirely too long. I broke the tie by saying, “The hospital”</p>

<p>On the way to the ER, Stacy was laid across the backseat of the Electra 225, head on my lap, legs on Greg’s. In a lucid moment, Stacy looked me in the eyes and said, “I got mine, didn’t I? I got mine.” At the time, I thought Stacy meant he got in a few good punches, but maybe he meant something else. “I got mine, didn’t I?”</p>

<p>Then Stacy had a single convulsion. Even his convulsion was cool. Just a push on my hand, a kick of his legs, then he coasted to a new world. Push, kick, coast… </p>
