<h2>Skate Baghdad!</h2>

		</p><p>Cracking plaster walls with rust-colored water stains, a sheet metal roof with patches of blue sky peeking through caved-in panels and a dusty cement floor littered with pebbles and pigeon droppings might seem like meager accommodations to many people, but it was exactly what a few men from the 172nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team’s Bravo Company had been looking for their whole tour of Iraq. To them, it was more than an abandoned warehouse, it was an escape from the rank-and-file military life, away from the thoughts of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), sniper fire, and uncooperative Iraqis. Armed with skate shoes, acoustic guitars, knitting needles and a battery-operated boom box, the men from Bravo Company created a slice of normalcy in the warehouse through skateboarding, music, and hanging around with friends. They made the most of their time, knowing that they could be called away at any moment to service a vehicle, go on a mission or mount a quick reaction force. They also knew first hand that tomorrow wasn’t promised to anyone and when promises were made, they were easily broken. </p>

<p>It was a broken promise that led the men from Bravo Company to their warehouse. In August of 2005, the Fort Wainwright, Alaska-based 172nd Stryker Brigade, made up of nearly 3,700 soldiers, was deployed to Iraq. They spent six months in Rawah patrolling the Iraqi-Syrian border in western Iraq and six months in the northern city of Mosul training Iraqi army and police forces.  </p>

<p>As their tour started to wind down in July of 2006, almost 300 soldiers, including 22-year-old Spc. James Bridges—a skinny guy called “Doug” around friends and family—had already headed back to Fort Wainwright to prepare the base for the brigade’s return home. The promise of that return was so close, even those not already there had started making plans. For Matthew Mason, a 22-year-old Sergeant from Naperville, Ill. whose hazel eyes are set behind wire-framed glasses, home meant a fishing trip with his father and friends. Tyler Smith, a chiseled high school running back turned machine gunner from suburban Seattle, was going to Las Vegas with some buddies to blow off steam. Shane Westergard, a baby-faced but muscular outdoorsmen, was going to hike the Appalachian Trail from north to south.  </p>

<p>But about five days before the brigade was to leave for Kuwait to fly home, rumors started to fly about a tour extension to help quell the sectarian war between Sunni and Shia Muslims that had spilled into Baghdad following the February bombing of the Al Askari mosque in Samarra, one of Shia Islam’s holiest sites.  </p>

<p>Aaron Grove, a friendly, well-spoken vehicle commander and Sergeant from Jackson, Mich., says he was sitting in an Iraqi police station in Mosul when he first heard about the extension. “Someone asked if I had heard the rumors,” he remembers. “And I was like, ‘Yeah, yeah—rumors.’ Rumors are worth nothing over there—especially in the Army—so I didn’t believe them. I thought I was going home in five days.” </p>

<p>The rumor made its way through the brigade and to the detainee facility on the outskirts of Mosul, where Sgt. Louie Bedea, a lanky, dark-haired 32-year-old from Milwaukee, had taken over for a soldier who had been injured in a recent mortar attack on the facility. “You often hear a lot of rumors, so I thought it was just a new one,” Bedea says. “But people from base came and picked me up with my bags and we got called into a battalion formation and they clarified what was going on.” </p>

<p>The rumors were true: After a year in-country the men of Bravo Company weren’t heading home. Instead they were joining Operation Together Forward II, the answer to a failed security plan aimed at sharply reducing the violence in Baghdad. Together Forward II, which recalled the nearly 300 soldiers who had already been in Alaska with their families for a month and redeployed the entire 172nd Stryker Brigade into the city for six months three days, called for US and Iraqi forces to sweep through all of Baghdad’s neighborhoods and clear each house of contraband weapons, terrorist propaganda and insurgents. Instead of heading home, Bravo Company was heading into the deadly center of a brewing civil war.  </p>

<p>But first they needed a place to live. To cope with the 3,700 new soldiers heading to the Army’s Camp Taji, which is about 20 miles north of Baghdad, a section of the camp that the Bravo soldiers thought was previously being used as a junkyard was prepared. </p>

<p>“They cleared out all of this trash and scraps of metal off to the side and set us up in there,” Bedea says. “I don’t think they had a lot of warning because they just made some quick quarters for us. They did a pretty good job even though we were pretty much living on top of each other in a junkyard.” </p>

<p>Exploring the base on one of his first days there, Mason found an old warehouse near the motor pool where the brigade’s Stryker vehicles were kept. He then noticed piles of scrap wood laying around and put an idea that had been forming all year into motion: he was going to build a skatepark. </p>

<p>“When we were in Rawah we thought that if everything was cement in Mosul we could get some skateboards and roll to the chow hall or something,” Mason says. “But Mosul was all gravel so we couldn’t. When we got to Taji and saw the warehouse I knew it was gonna happen.” </p>

<p>Within days of being at Taji, Mason, Bedea, Smith and Westergard had surfed the Internet and to find skateboard companies that would ship overseas. Then they set out to find some power tools and scavenge all the wood they could find and got to work. When they were finished building, they had a kicker ramp, a quarter pipe and a fun box to skate on. Beyond that, they had a place to get away from everything.  </p>

<p>Out in the warehouse, they could be themselves again. Their new boards and new space meant they could try new tricks like they were back home; those who didn't skate, like Bridges, took their time in the warehouse as a chance to get away from the military machismo by knitting scarves and hats. At the warehouse, soldiers could be out of their fatigues, combat boots and body armor—the T-shirts and shorts they wore instead offered relief from the summer temperatures that climbed to nearly 120 degrees. Some who skated pulled their socks up high to protect their shins from ill-fated kick-flips, heel-flips, and shove-its.  </p>

<p>The relaxed atmosphere and dress code didn’t stop the reminders of what lurked outside: The men’s bare arms displayed the black metallic wristbands many of the soldiers wore in honor of their friend, Spc. Joshua Pearce, who was killed instantly when an IED tore a basketball-size hole into his vehicle directly beneath where he was sitting.  </p>

<p>All of the soldiers had close calls of their own; there had been so many IEDs they had lost count, but they all remember the big ones. Mason and Grove, for example, were patrolling in Mosul when their Stryker rolled over an anti-personnel mine, blowing out seven tires and peppering the side of the vehicle with ball bearings and other pieces of shrapnel.  </p>

<p>Mason, who had been standing in the rear air-guard hatch pulling security, was knocked back into the vehicle from the blast. “It filled my mouth with dirt and I couldn’t hear or see anything,” Mason says. “All I could hear was ringing and all I could see was dust inside the Stryker.” </p>

<p>“If we had been five or six feet to the left, it probably would have sprayed him in the face,” Grove says. “Luckily I was driving in the dead center of the road and doing what I needed to do.” </p>

<p>Westergard remembers standing with a medic in a courtyard while his platoon sergeant was inside a home talking with a family when an insurgent opened up on the soldiers with a light machine gun from a couple of houses away. With bullets ricocheting off the house in front of them, Westergard dove behind a low brick wall and the medic took cover behind a small pole that barely covered him. </p>

<p>“Doc looked at me and was like, ‘Dude, is this even covering me?’” Westergard says. “I was like, ‘No,’ and we both started laughing until a tracer round caught a bush on fire that was between us. So we ran inside the house.” </p>

<p>While in Mosul, Bridges’  Stryker had come under attack by a sniper, and a round ricocheted off the vehicle and struck his helmet in the base plate of his night vision goggles.  </p>

<p>It was memories like these that got kick-pushed away when out in the warehouse. Skateboarding was a connection to easier times—Mason and Smith had skated since middle school and Bedea had an interest in it in the early 1990s—and it lead to talk of past lives. Unfortunately, their reminiscing was cut short most days, either by jobs that needed doing on base or missions that jolted them back to the realities of Iraq. </p>

<p>On missions, there wasn’t the feeling of goodwill that filled the air of the warehouse. On the streets of Baghdad, the stench of sewage permeated the air, coupled with a feeling of despair and helplessness with the deteriorating situation in the neighborhoods.  </p>

<p>The streets could literally explode at any time. The soldiers had gotten used to the threat of hitting an IED in Rawah and Mosul, but the mood of Baghdad was more ominous and brooding. The Iraqis didn’t trust the Americans, and the Americans didn’t trust the Iraqis. When passing through the Sadr City neighborhood of Baghdad, a sprawling slum controlled by Shi’a cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who also controls the Shi’a Mahdi militia, Mason says it was common for children to attack the vehicle by throwing rocks at it. “People would spit at us, shoot at us—someone got a grenade thrown at them as they passed,” he says.  </p>

<p>To the soldiers, gunfire and indifference was just one of those things you got used to. </p>

<p>“You learn to know when it’s something to worry about and when it isn’t,” Grove says. “Some people are more jumpy than others. I got used to being in an area where there probably were going to be shots fired in my direction. I guess it comes with the territory when you act as an overbearing father figure to the Iraqi Army and police. Instead of letting them respond to a car bomb or shooting, we would rush to the scene. They’re not going to get in our face to stop us because we’ve got bigger guns and better equipment. So the way they see it, it’s better that we die than them.” </p>

<p>Even on occasions when the Strykers would try to encourage the Iraqis to stand up for themselves, it seemed expected that the Americans would get the job done for them. On one such occasion, a couple Iraqi soldiers flagged down Smith and Grove’s passing convoy. As it slowed to a halt, the Iraqi soldiers told the Americans’ interpreter that there were people about to be executed a couple of streets over. A Lieutenant with the convoy told the interpreter to ask the Iraqis why they weren’t trying to stop what was happening. </p>

<p>“The Iraqi soldiers said something to the translator and the translator said, ‘They said it’s not their responsibility, sir,’” Grove says. “At the time all you can really think is what the hell is wrong with these people? What the hell are we doing when Iraqi soldiers are telling us that it’s not their responsibility to stop the violence that’s going on in their home? It’s not like the US Army where you join up and get stationed far away from your home. Most of these guys join up and go to basic training, then get assigned to the same places they’re from. I don’t understand why they don’t want to protect their home.” </p>

<p>Grove and Bedea say incidents like that were all too common in Baghdad, which made a soldier’s life that much more miserable. And it wasn’t just the Iraqi soldiers who were indifferent to the violence. Most of the time when an IED went off, soldiers were forced to dismount and subsequently search the neighborhood to find information on who carried out the attack. Some days they would spend upwards of eight hours going door to door clearing houses.   </p>

<p>“Sometimes you would get hit by three or four IEDs in one town, and nobody saw anything, nobody knows anything,” Bedea says. “Every neigborhood it’s the same thing: ‘There’s no bad people here. This is a great neighborhood.’ It makes you think that if the neighborhood is so good, then how the hell are these bombs getting planted right in the middle of the street? People are around doing all this stuff and no one sees a damn thing? It’s crazy.” </p>

<p>Though it angered the soldiers that many Iraqis were unwilling to help out, Bedea says he understood that they were afraid of reprisals against their family. </p>

<p>“If someone found out that they gave Americans information their family would likely get executed,” he says. “You always keep in the back of your mind that hey, these people are scared. But at the same time we can’t do this all on our own. It’s their neighborhood. They know what’s going on. They know who the outsiders are. They’re just afraid to talk. But with the right information maybe we could actually get these guys off the street and clean up their neighborhood. It’s a tough situation.” </p>

<p>Despite the uncooperativeness of many of Iraq’s citizens, many managed to leave a mark on the men, like their interpreter, James, a Kurdish tailor from the northern city of Dahuk who could speak three languages, and regularly translated conversations between Kurdish, Arabic and English. Many of the soldiers still keep in touch with him via e-mail. </p>

<p>“He was very street smart,” Grove says. “He could go to any neighborhood and speak to anyone. He just had something about him. He could be talking to an Iraqi Army officer from Kurdistan, a soldier from Mosul and our commanding officer and he would be translating from Kurdish to Arabic to English and back.” </p>

<p>Mason also has fond memories of the time he spent with Iraqi soldiers while he was waiting for his commanding officer during weekly meetings at a base in Baghdad. With several hours to spare and no real need to worry about security, Mason got into the habit of bringing his skateboard and shoes along with him in his Stryker on the treks to the base, where he would change out of his combat boots and show the Iraqi soldiers a trick or two.  </p>

<p>“They loved it,” he says. “They even tried it themselves, but they’d usually put one foot on the board and fly backwards to the ground.” </p>

<p>As the months wore on, time in the warehouse as a group grew scarce. Many of the guys who hung out around the warehouse were working opposite hours, which kept the group from hooking up and skating together.  </p>

<p>But a few weeks before the 172nd was to head back to the Fort Wainwright, everyone got to meet up and skate together. The old crowd had congregated, with Pearce memorialized on the soldiers' wrists. They reminisced about old times, talked about going home and skated. On this day, nobody came to grab them to mount up a mission, nobody needed a vehicle to be repaired; they skated to their heart’s content. They cheered when Bedea finally landed a kick-flip off the kicker ramp—something he had been trying for months—and they laughed and talked together for hours. </p>

<p>It was the last day they all would all hang out—a few days later, on Nov. 4, 2006, Bridges' platoon was out on patrol when it slowed to stop at a checkpoint. As the convoy came to a halt, a sniper found a helmet peeking out of the rear air-guard hatch of one of the Strykers and fired a shot, killing Bridges. He would have been on his way home in less than a month. It was one last brutal reminder of the reality they could only deny while in the warehouse.  </p>

<p>“When we were skating with all of us together it was like we weren’t really there,” Bedea says. “There wasn’t anything getting in the way. We didn’t have to worry about rank. It was just a bunch of guys hanging out trying to have a good time. We all knew we were still in Iraq and what we were doing, but being able to skate and hang out with friends was like a little piece of home.”</p>
