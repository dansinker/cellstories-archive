<h2>Laura</h2>
	<h3>Tessa Smith</h3>

		</p><p>On Mondays, Laura couldn’t eat bread. It hadn’t always been that way, but everything changed one Monday in May. Peter left for the office and Jenny, their twelve year old, left for school, and Laura was standing at the sink, ready to pour bleach into a small plastic bowl to soak Peter’s stained tube socks. She bit into a slice of white bread and butter and, almost immediately, felt a fierce itching on her chest. Resisting the urge to scratch, she ran to the mirror in the bathroom and pulled down the front of her old white T shirt. Angry red spots dotted her chest. She leaned into the mirror, momentarily distracted by the gray at her temples. Her brown hair, tied back in a neat ponytail, looked otherwise the same as it had since she was a child. She frowned. What had caused those spots? It could only be the bread or butter. But she’d been eating them all her life, why the sudden change? Perhaps it wasn’t the food. But, somehow, she felt that it was.</p>

<p>      Twenty minutes later, the spots and itching had disappeared. Puzzled, Laura went back to the kitchen and scooped a fingerful of soft, misshapen butter. She swallowed it and ran back to the mirror. She waited. Nothing. It must be the bread.</p>

<p>      In the kitchen, she took a loaf of Italian white out of the bread bin. She undid the wire tie, extracted a single slice and sniffed it. It smelled normal, yeasty and fresh. She turned it over. A shower of sesame seeds fell from the crust. She took a careful bite. Her chest began to prickle.</p>

<p>      Strangely excited, Laura dumped the stained socks in the trash and put the bowl and the bleach under the sink. She snatched her keys and bag and drove to Sainsbury’s. Standing in the Express checkout with a French stick and a loaf of wholewheat, she realized she’d left her shopping list at home. Not since she was at Wimbledon College, before she Peter and love and marriage, had she been to the supermarket for so few things. She gave a nervous giggle and stopped when the old man in front of her turned to stare.</p>

<p>      At home, Laura set the two loaves on the pine table in the kitchen. She broke off the end of the French stick, scattering crumbs across the grooves of well-polished wood. Her skin began to tingle. Then, in the mirror, she shrugged and smiled, and didn’t bother to try the whole wheat.</p>

<p>      That afternoon, when Jenny came home, Laura showed her, just in case it was Laura’s imagination. Jenny rolled her eyes to heaven, opened her mouth and let her tongue loll out briefly. “Oh <i>duh</i>, Mother. Like you can <i>suddenly</i> get allergic,” she said.</p>

<p>      Well, you can actually, Laura thought.</p>

<p>      Jenny held a slice of whole wheat under her mother’s nose. “Eat,” she ordered.</p>

<p>      Laura took a tiny bite and blotches rose as if to silent command. She shook her head apologetically and Jenny stormed off in disgust.</p>

<p>      The next day, Tuesday, Laura cautiously nibbled some French bread. She swallowed and went to the bathroom. Her face seemed calm, newly familiar. Nothing. She tried the Italian white and the whole wheat. Not a blotch in sight.</p>

<p>      That night, when Jenny was upstairs, Laura and Peter sat down for dinner. “That blasted Lawrence got all the credit, and he made a complete bollocks of the whole convention,” Peter complained, dripping thin brown lines of French onion soup on his white shirt. His black hair, already feathered gray, flopped forward onto his noble forehead, shining under the electric lights.  As he spoke, Laura nodded from time to time, thinking, as she often did, how handsome he was and what a shame that he always had to save the day at work. Lawrence must be very wily. She replaced the soup bowls with pork chops from the oven, a small plate for Laura and a large one for Peter. As Peter ate two chops, runner beans and mash, Laura quietly described her ‘allergy for a day’.</p>

<p>      Peter dismissed the idea. “Don’t be daft. You can’t become allergic to something just for one day,” he said with his mouth full. “Got any apple sauce?”</p>

<p>      Laura fetched the little pot of apple sauce from the fridge. Of course he was right. But no, she remembered - Jenny had seen it too. Laura wasn’t imagining things. Was she creating it? Psychosomatic, or whatever the word was. She sat down, took a bite of her pork chop, having saved it for last, and felt the familiar itchy sensation.</p>

<p>      She peered at her chest.</p>

<p>      Peter inspected the bumps. “Oh, for goodness’ sake!” he said, irritated, and his fork clattered onto the plate.</p>

<p>      Meekly Laura shrugged. “Maybe it’s meat on Tuesdays,” she said jokingly.</p>

<p>      Peter snorted and threw back the last of his wine.</p>

<p>      That night, after Peter and Jenny were both asleep, when Laura would usually set the table for breakfast, she found she was still hungry. She opened a cupboard and surveyed the contents. The house seemed more silent than usual. She chose a tin of pea and ham soup and a strange queasiness unfurled in her stomach--no, not queasiness, more like excitement: she was going to test her allergy theory.</p>

<p>      Laura stirred the green liquid until it began to boil. Words from college English lit. classes bubbled up. “Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble…” She had been good at English—Mrs. Sims said she should teach, she remembered, and the thought lifted her spirit like the memory of a grand achievement. She stirred the soup and cackled like a witch. The cracked sound echoed off the terracotta floor and made her wonder if she was going a little mad. Suddenly it seemed bizarre—impossible—that ordinary foods, things she’d eaten forever, were doing this to her. She sat at the table and dipped her spoon into the steaming broth, lifted it to her mouth and blew a long, continuous breath, rippling mushy green around the red lines of the ham. She slid the spoon into her mouth, felt the ridged meat on her tongue and chewed in slow motion, waiting, straining her senses to detect its effect. And there it was; that irresistible sensation like specks of fire dust. She trotted to the bathroom; little cherries formed right in front of her eyes.</p>

<p>      The next morning, Wednesday, she ate more ham. Even after five chunks of meat, her skin stayed creamy clear. She tipped the rest into a plastic container and put it in the fridge.</p>

<p>      “You’d better get help,” Peter said, as he closed the door behind him on the way to work. </p>

<p>      The allergist was a slim man in his fifties with a tan and gray hair cropped close to his skull. He listened to her story with his chin cupped in his palm. “Allergies come in all shapes and sizes but I’ve never heard of anything like this.” He gazed at her reflectively, his blue eyes curious, and Laura felt herself begin to blush. “It doesn’t seem to be doing too much harm. I suggest you watch your diet, note which foods are a problem on which days and then come back and see me again.”</p>

<p>      Laura began to feel a strange sense of importance. There was no denying the red marks, her whole family could see them. Each day they waited curiously to see what she was allergic to now. She’d stand there patiently while they inspected her. She forsook her tee shirts and began wearing white blouses with a collar and buttons so that she could check herself more easily.</p>

<p>      Five weeks later, the whole spectrum of allergies was known. On Mondays, she couldn’t eat bread, on Tuesdays, meat. On Wednesdays it was fruit and on Thursdays, dairy. On Fridays, chocolate and Saturdays, leafy green vegetables. Only Sundays remained free, a day she could eat anything she wanted. By now, Laura’s allergies felt more like a comforting routine than a problem so she didn’t bother to go back to the allergist. Instead, she began to try new foods.</p>

<p>      Sunday’s routine was particularly pleasant. Peter, an ex-rugby player, would be out all day, watching the Old Purleans and then having dinner at the clubhouse. Jenny would be at a friend’s. Before her allergies, Laura used to check the week’s activities on the calendar, prepare Jenny’s soccer outfit and iron Peter’s shirts, but this particular Sunday, when Peter came home unexpectedly early, he stopped and stared, his key still in the lock of the open front door. “What’s this?” He said. “Why’s the good china out?”</p>

<p>      Laura, seated at the dining room table, froze in mid-chew. The long mahogany table was laid with white bone china dishes and each dish held a single, tiny serving of food. Two white candles burned in crystal candlestick holders. The stereo played Italian opera, a CD Laura rarely played because no-one else liked it. Laura sat at the head of the table, in Peter’s seat, holding a silver goblet in her hand.</p>

<p>      “Laura?”</p>

<p>      Laura felt a flush rise from beneath her navy silk blouse, undone to the third button. Peter, quite forgetting to shut the door, dropped into the chair to Laura’s left, where she usually sat. Laura’s flush subsided. Her fingers loosened their grip on the stem of the goblet. She took a sharp breath, as if about to speak--to defend herself perhaps—then exhaled in a rush.</p>

<p>      Peter waited, staring. He looked like one of those impossibly handsome figures in Madame Tussaud’s waxworks.</p>

<p>      “Well,” she explained, “these dishes are everything I can’t eat during the week. And these - ” she pointed from dish to dish, “are avocadoes, nectarines, poached salmon, tabouleh with a hint of garlic, and fresh pineapple.”</p>

<p>      Laura stood, walked to the dresser and unlatched the glass doors. She took down another goblet and, shaking it gently, she smiled. “Want some wine?” </p>
