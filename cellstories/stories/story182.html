<h2>Lopping and Removal in Three Parts </h2>
	<h3>Deborah Sheldon</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>Our story starts like this:</p>

<p>  John, after slogging for some twenty years as an accountant, set up his dream business – tree lopping and removals - against the wishes of his wife, Ellen. She fretted about losing their home and investments and having to live in the Land Cruiser. But John’s business instincts were right and for a brief and beautiful time, John and Ellen enjoyed the happiest and richest years of their married life. Ellen indulged in restaurants and shoes, while their two grown children had extra mortgage payments and college fees respectively. Then things changed. John’s desires for the unsavoury took all the money. </p>

<p>      What a shame. </p>

<p>      That version of the story was exactly 100 words. The next version expands upon the particular details surrounding the end of John’s golden financial era: </p>

<p>      In the grip of a mid-life crisis, John throws in his accountancy career for a tree lopping and removals business. The Australian drought gives him and his team of lumberjacks no end of suburban ghost gums to cut down and chip before the limbs can drop and crush passers-by. Money flows. Within a couple of years, however, John’s exponentially increased whoring, gambling and meth-amphetamine use undermine his business until finally, today, it ends.</p>

<p>      Bankcards are refused. Wife demands explanation. Humiliation is complete.</p>

<p>      John, suddenly feeling ridiculous in his customary wool and cashmere, is pinned by Ellen’s glare against the metre-wide hearth that forms the centrepiece of their three-storey home. He says, “It’ll be okay, darling, I promise, I’ll get us out of this,” but the whole time he’s confessing his agonising failure to his wife of twenty-three years, John is thinking about his favourite girl Candy. He presses fingertips into his eyelids, willing the fog to clear. He has to focus on turning this disaster around. He’s got to forget his dreams that never eventuated, and his kids that smirk at him, and his loneliness with Ellen, and the feel of Candy’s PVC cowboy chaps, and concentrate.</p>

<p>      Ellen flees the room. John longs for a hit, goes to the kitchen to settle for whisky. Through the window, flowers in his professionally landscaped backyard drowse under the birch tree. He paid for it all but doesn’t know the names of any of the blossoming plants. This seems significant. He takes another drink while Ellen sobs and smashes belongings upstairs.</p>

<p>      Concentrate. The flowers are purple and yellow.</p>

<p>      I have to concentrate.</p>

<p>      He could sell the house, the Land Cruiser, the caravan, investment property. Not enough. Well, what about bankruptcy? That would make financial sense, but no. No. Death would be better than that. Then suicide occurs to him as a reasonably attractive option. John rolls the whisky around in his mouth, tasting it for a while, and hits upon a wonderful realisation.</p>

<p>      He takes the stairs two at a time. Ellen is in the master bedroom standing round-shouldered and hiccupping in the midst of ruin. His smile infuriates her.</p>

<p>      “You bastard! I gave up everything for you!”</p>

<p>      John ponders momentarily the mystery of what in hell she could have given up, then approaches, crunching in his handmade shoes over the broken mirror, jewellery box, lamps. He hardly notices when she slaps him.</p>

<p>      He says, “We’ll fake my death and collect the insurance.”</p>

<p>      Two weeks later, Ellen tells police that John didn’t return from his dip in the sea. His memorial is apparently well attended. Only Ellen knows that John is living in their 24ft caravan in the backyard. The caravan is a prison that suffocates him and guilt over his children’s grief chokes him but the debts are clear, his business is thriving, the house is safe and Ellen has her restaurants and shoes.</p>

<p>      And a lover.</p>

<p>      The pain of it almost kills him. Ellen is sleeping with one of John’s lumberjacks.  </p>

<p>      What a shame.</p>

<p>      That version of the story was exactly 500 words. The next version expands upon the particular details surrounding the aftermath of John’s faked death: </p>

<p>Ellen balanced the tray on one hand and went to knock. She stepped back as the caravan door flung open. He stood in the doorway in his filthy Y-fronts, unshaven and red-eyed.</p>

<p>      “Hello, John,” she said. “I’ve got your breakfast.”</p>

<p>        “Oh yeah? Well, I don’t want it,” he said, sneering. “I don’t want anything from you, slut, you scrubber. Is he up there? He was my best lumberjack, goddamn it. Answer me, why don’t you? Have you got Ricky up there in my bed?”</p>

<p>      She said, “You’re drunk again. Maybe I should limit your whisky.”</p>

<p>      “No, wait, there’s no need for that. Please, darling. I’ve got nothing else.”</p>

<p>      “Then don’t bait me.”</p>

<p>      She held out the tray. On it sat a cup of flat white coffee, cutlery, a dry bowl of cereal, a jug of milk, two pieces of bread and a pat of butter smeared on a square of greaseproof paper. John stared at the food.</p>

<p>      “Take it,” Ellen said. “I don’t have all day.”</p>

<p>      “Why not? Is Ricky up there?”</p>

<p>      Ellen made a move and John snatched at the tray. He put it on the caravan’s table and said, “Listen, I just want you to know, I’ve been thinking.”</p>

<p>      Ellen narrowed her eyes. “About what?”</p>

<p>      “This. All of this,” he said, gesturing behind him, and then he sobbed. “I can’t do it any more.”</p>

<p>      “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>      “I mean I’m going to confess to the police.”</p>

<p>      Ellen didn’t answer for a time. She said, “If you do, then we both go to jail for insurance fraud. John, the whole world thinks you’re dead.”</p>

<p>      “So? I’m in jail anyway. No, it’s worse than that, I’m in hell, jail would be a relief.” His mouth wobbled into a smile and fresh tears shimmered in his eyes. “We’re a team, aren’t we? Husband and wife for twenty-five years, we can make this right, we can undo everything we’ve done, you see? I don’t need meth any more. I could run my tree lopping and removal business again, I swear. And I really want to see the kids, Ellen. Please. You understand, don’t you?”</p>

<p>      Ellen nodded. “I’ll come back in a little while and we’ll talk about it some more.”</p>

<p>      Ellen squared her shoulders and walked across the yard to the back door. Once hidden inside the house, she sagged against the kitchen table, trembling. She forced herself to calm down. For god’s sake, she was a business mogul, with dozens of men in her employ, a turnover worth millions. She could handle this bump along the road.</p>

<p>      In the living room, Ricky was slumped on the couch in his boxer shorts playing a shoot-em-up game on the Xbox 360. He held the control pad in both hands, and each frenzied finger-tap on the buttons shivered the meat in his shoulders and chest and clenched his abdominal muscles drum-tight. It wasn’t that Ricky was brawny, just young – barely out of his teens, in fact - and bereft of body fat.</p>

<p>      “Ricky,” she said at last, and he looked up with chocolate eyes. She smiled and said, “I need your help.”</p>

<p>      He tossed the control pad to the couch and came over, putting his hands on her. He smelt like fresh bread. They kissed and it was a long, hard and deep kiss that stirred the seat of her pants and thumped her heart against her ribs. (Admittedly, Ricky was inexperienced and overeager – he had a problem with premature ejaculation and actually wasn’t that good at foreplay or oral sex – but it didn’t matter, because his unflinching adoration wiped away twenty or more years of joyless living. John wasn’t the only one who could benefit from a little candy.)</p>

<p>      “Sweetie,” she said, “we’ve got an awful problem. Help me, please, help mama fix it.”</p>

<p>      And he did. Never underestimate a young man’s infatuation with an older woman, particularly one who looks good for her age. Ricky strangled John and fed his corpse through the wood chipper, aiming the crimson spray at the flowerbeds in Ellen’s backyard. John’s legacy is an exceptionally vibrant display of irises the following autumn, with the purple and yellow petals so intense that Ellen has to keep the kitchen blinds drawn to stave off migraines. Ricky is also gone. In an unfortunate chainsaw accident, he severed the femoral artery in his left thigh and bled out within four minutes while attempting to cut down the birch tree in Ellen’s backyard. Ellen lives alone and enjoys restaurants and shoes. </p>

<p>      What a shame.</p>

<p>      That version of the story was exactly 750 words. So what happens next? A few notes:</p>

<p>      Ellen’s involvement in either John’s or Ricky’s death (or why not both) is discovered and she is sent to prison. Or she lives a good life with a new lover, but falls prey to dementia in later years and is sent by her uncaring children to a nursing home where she is alternately abused and neglected. Or her new lover betrays her by seducing her daughter and Ellen never sees either of them again. Or her son discovers her convoluted and decidedly evil plot and goes mad or turns to drugs like his father or runs off with Ellen’s new lover or starts sleeping with his sister, any of which could break Ellen’s heart so thoroughly that her chosen recourse is suicide, or whatever. Possible complications abound. Suffice to say that the story of John and Ellen and their cast of minor characters could keep extrapolating cause and effect for version after version, but for the purposes of verisimilitude, each version must end in tears. </p>
