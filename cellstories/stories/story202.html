<h2>Fighting Words</h2>

		</p><p>I could pass if I wanted to. Nobody follows me around in a store, and I’ve only been pulled over for speeding.</p>

<p>      I can go through Harlem and DC, along with Houston’s Fifth Ward and most of Atlanta, without hearing a panhandler say “Why won’t you help out another brother?” then call me “Oreo” or “bougie” when I keep walking. I’ve been mistaken for Jewish and Lebanese, and once somebody thought I was Armenian. That still makes me trip. At the airport in Las Vegas a high roller whose comped drinks hadn’t worn off just said, “What are you?” After I explained he thanked me for my time and shook my hand--I’ll give him credit for that--but he was holding back something from his grip.</p>

<p>      That’s why it throws people off sometimes when I go down the street humming “Lift Every Voice and Sing.” But I don’t need the Nation of Islam bowtie and bean pie posse to tell me who I am. I’ve got my one drop and then some. </p>

<p>      Exactly how a blue-black man born in Holly Springs, Mississippi ended up marrying a white woman in the 1920s never got explained to me, but they stayed together until she passed on, before I was born. Great-Granddad James (we usually left out the “great”) didn’t join her until I was in college. He was getting tired by the time I finished high school, but when I walked across the stage at graduation he said, and loud enough to get heard from the opposite bleachers, “Hoo! Look at the big man!”</p>

<p>      We’d gotten to do a lot up to that point, since one regular grand-dad died in World War II and the other fell into a bottle somewhere; nobody had heard from him since the sixties.  Granddad James took me into the big A.M.E. Church on 79th Street in Chicago enough that I still get my nose out of joint just thinking about the crowds that just think of gospel choirs as a side dish for their Sunday brunch. Once Granddad James even took me along to see Muddy Waters (“Mr. Morganfield” or “sir,” as I was to call him) after the King Bee had packed up his guitar and moved to Western Springs in the suburbs; they were some kind of shirt-tail relation. Which made me one, too. Damn. Mr. Morganfield said, “Boy looks like Charlie Patton.”</p>

<p>      Mostly I would go over to his house while he cooked. There was plenty of time of time to talk; he fried up pork chops until you could have used them to resole his Stacey Adams shoes. (“I seen what trichinosis done to a man once,” he always told me.) Otherwise he knew what he was doing.  I begged like a dog for his sweet-potato pie, and the first vegetable I ever willingly ate was his collard greens. When I was about six I didn’t have my words right and called them “coloreds,” and he laughed before setting me straight so that I wouldn’t get into any drama somewhere else.</p>

<p>      I couldn’t go the distance to chitlins, though, even before I dissected a fetal pig in high school biology. I’d only dare him, saying “You’re not going to eat that,” and he would say right back “You just watch me, boy.” I did, and he did. Only toward the end did he say, “That ain’t for everybody. You get a taste for it early or you don’t get it at all. Was a damn sight better than going to bed hungry every night.” </p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>It wasn’t exactly clear why I was thinking about this in the bar at Chicago Union Station while I waited to take a less crowded train home. There’s no telling what you can start thinking about when you’ve had to miss lunch for a meeting, with nothing since but one Manhattan and most of a second; they go down easy enough, and you can pretend the maraschino cherry is food.</p>

<p>      Manhattan the Third, Maker’s Mark, straight up, took its place on a coaster in front of me, and I let the drink sit for now. I was already set up proper. I’d forgotten to bring anything to read--it had been that kind of day from the start--but going to the newsstand could cost me my seat. This left the television, turned to news or what somebody decided was news: an earthquake in Asia, famine in Ethiopia, stocks that most people don’t own, crimes done to and/or by the African-American community. The sports showed a pitchout by a Cubs reliever that loaded the bases, then an Astros grand slam.</p>

<p>      The drinker a couple of stools away, who looked about sixty and had been there when I arrived, was reloading with a fresh Old Style. He offered an assessment that network color commentators could only dream of giving.</p>

<p>      “That pitcher must have balls the size of peas.”</p>

<p>      Not looking to join the conversation, I held back a laugh. </p>

<p>      “I don’t know,” said a younger man to his right, who had also been there from the first.  “That batter’s been on a tear lately, and the next guy was in a slump.”</p>

<p>      “Hell of a way to break out of it.”</p>

<p>      “Yeah.”</p>

<p>      The broadcast moved on, and their talk. Without another disaster, or a baby animal at the Brookfield Zoo, the producers scraped the bottom of the barrel and found a science item: new evidence that humans were descended from a handful of women in East Africa.</p>

<p>      “You feel African?” asked the commentator.</p>

<p>      “Not today,” said the partner. “If I did I might be running with a football and getting  a couple million dollars.”</p>

<p>      “Or food stamps and a welfare check.”</p>

<p>      This wasn’t the time or place to school my bar-mates on the welfare reforms of the nineties and the origin of food stamps as a farm subsidy. I didn’t have the details chapter and verse, and they didn’t look like they would spend their Wednesday evening looking them up online. I’m not proud of it, but I have a prejudice or two of my own.</p>

<p>      All I needed to do was catch a train, and I was taking tomorrow off for a parent-teacher conference.  I gripped the rocks glass and thought about taking a sip, then didn’t.</p>

<p>   “They can run like hell, though,” the partner said.</p>

<p>      “Put a stolen chicken under their arms you’ll see fast they can really run.”</p>

<p>      The partner chortled once, then turned thoughtful in a half-drunken way. “But that’s a hell of a thing, though. You ever wonder why they can do that?”</p>

<p>      “I don’t think, I know,” said the commentator. “A lot of things make them different.”</p>

<p>      The way some people collected old-school lawn jockeys and segregated water fountain signs, sometimes I liked to count how many knuckleheaded claims in  Column A would match the knuckleheaded claims I’d  heard before in Column B.</p>

<p>      “They’re put together different for jungle skills like outrunning a lion.”</p>

<p>      Check. Lions lived on savannahs and not in rain forests, and not even Carl Lewis in his prime could have outrun a motivated lion.</p>

<p>      “That’s why they’ve got an extra bone in their foot.” Check. “And their backbones slide in some kind of way. That’s why they can dance like that.” Check. Possibly check again.  The part about rhythm was implied.</p>

<p>      “But they sure don’t read or write so good,” the partner said. “Why’s that?”        </p>

<p>      “Reading and writing, my friend, are not exactly jungle skills. That’s why those people are fast instead of smart.” Still not joining in, I didn’t bring up my Richard Wright first editions and signed copy of Invisible Man. Or the biography of Pushkin, black like me.</p>

<p>  “But you take anything physical and they’re all over it when they feel like it.”</p>

<p>      “That gets back to their jungle equipment and how they handle the heat,” said the expert in human variation. “They don’t sweat, they secrete a kind of oil.” No check. This was a new one.</p>

<p>      “You‘re kidding.”</p>

<p>      “No. When I was growing up my doctor told me about it.”</p>

<p>      “But they’re still human.”</p>

<p>      “Hell, you can call a horse a human if you want to.”</p>

<p>      It probably wouldn’t have helped to whinny or neigh, Mr. Ed in a Brooks Brothers suit, but that crossed my mind. Maybe I should have.</p>

<p>      “Don’t get me wrong,” the partner said, “I don’t like niggers.” He caught himself and gave the room a once-over, relaxing over his glass in a way that meant You can say ‘nigger’ here, then added, “but they‘re more or less like us.”</p>

<p>      “That’s where you’re wrong, my friend. It’s like that doctor told me. The nigger is a lower breed, and it’s time we stopped treating them like they weren’t.”</p>

<p>      There was a lull in the conversation. This was the time and the place. After picking a few words, I joined in. </p>

<p>      “Excuse me, sir. Your comments are becoming offensive.”</p>

<p>      “Oh, Christ,” the commentator said. He looked me over with eyes that couldn’t quite focus. “Are you one of those ACLU civil rights people that goes around looking to stand up for principles?”  He ended the word “principles” with an “sh” sound. I didn’t have a chance to answer the question. “It’s not like you’re one of them.”</p>

<p>      “Sir, I am one of them.”    </p>

<p>      He paused. “Then how come you’re so articulate?”</p>

<p>      You never know when the A-word is going to come up, but you always know how, as a pat on the head, another way of saying “one of the good ones.” Articulate with the unspoken condition “for one of them.”</p>

<p>      I didn’t answer the question but thought of a poem Granddad James had shown me. I wore the mask.</p>

<p>      “Sir, if you could only be considerate I would appreciate it.”</p>

<p>      “You don’t have to listen.”  At this point a friend could have said “Take it easy,” called him by his first name and put a hand on his shoulder, buying time to think.   </p>

<p>      “Sir, this is a public place and you’re nearby. It‘s hard not to listen.”</p>

<p>      I had tried to give him a graceful way out, but I had apparently failed. The man tensed up like someone cornered.</p>

<p>      “Then listen to this,” he said, raising his voice. People were watching now. “I am going to say whatever the hell I want, and there’s not a goddamned thing you can do about it.” He added, “Nigger.”</p>

<p>      The word hung in the air like a puff of foul smoke.</p>

<p>      Now I tensed up, backed into a corner of my own. In some circles the African-American male has a reputation for poor impulse control, but no one sees the impulses we do control. I pushed down a few, hard, before giving in to one.</p>

<p>      The mask came off.</p>

<p>      I splashed the man with my drink.</p>

<p>      “Motherfucker,” he slurred and rose to his feet. I didn’t draw back right away, because I didn’t believe what he was doing, and he caught my jaw with most of a right hook. I gripped the bar so as not to fall, then stood up.</p>

<p>      I didn’t want this. Not the embarrassment, not the damage to my suit, not the disruption of my evening. None of it. I backed up, but he kept coming.</p>

<p>      I didn’t back up again. I blocked his next punch and tagged him in the ribs, and we stood there teeing off on each other until we ran out of breath, then we clinched and worked in a shot here and there: one more fight between out-of-shape men. Neither of us would step off.</p>

<p>      I heard the barmaid shout and make a phone call, then comments around the bar, but not for long.</p>

<p>      Two officers arrived with a quickness. This time of day they wouldn’t have much else to do besides rattle the benches in the Great Hall to keep the vagrants awake. One policeman pulled my hands behind my back and handcuffed me before the other could restrain his suspect, who got in one more punch.</p>

<p>      I don’t know what the other officer did with his man. Mine, a chocolate-skinned man a few years older than me, walked me through the station and up the stairs to Canal Street.</p>

<p>      He didn’t ask me any questions, or read me my rights; so far I wasn’t formally under arrest.  I watched the traffic and tried to read his expression, but couldn’t, and stood there wondering why the CPD hatband was a checkerboard of black and white. </p>

<p>      As the patrol car pulled up I asked, “Do you know what happened?“</p>

<p>      He shook his head no without meeting my eyes. He’d probably had his fill of conversations like this. I hadn’t.</p>

<p>      “That man called me a nigger.”</p>

<p>      Now the officer looked me over, searching my features for something like his own. He didn’t offer any validation, but to his credit he didn’t laugh at me.</p>

<p>      “I am one,” I said as a patrol car pulled up for me.</p>

<p>      He opened the front door and put my briefcase in the passenger side, then opened the back door for me.</p>

<p>      “You are now, my brother,“ he said. He placed his right hand on top of my head to protect it from the door frame and roof, guiding me into the back seat with something that seemed like tenderness.</p>
