<h2>Dear Diary</h2>
	<h3>Khanisha Foster</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>Ok, there are some things that you just don’t do. Things that everyone agrees are wrong, and I’m going to tell you about doing one of those things... here goes:  I read my sister’s diary... actually I stole her diary... and then I read it. </p>

<p>It was junior high and we’d just entered the nineties. My older sister Sheridan had a guilty smile and a body, that even at 12, looked like it belonged to a perky 21-year-old. The boys became adoring puppy dogs when she was around; and the girls would puff out their chests-- trying to prove they were tough enough to hang out with her. She’d easily slipped into her group of friends, a group called the bitch click. They were a mass of denim skirts, dark lipstick, and side pony tails-- as they walked down the gray locker filled hallway.  They were cool, but in that rebellious <i>My So Called Life</i> kind of way, which made them untouchable. </p>

<p>Everyone wanted to know their secrets: they had this ability to dismiss anyone who wasn't in their circle, and it was alluring. The cool kids made it clear that there would be a spot for me at their table at lunch--if I could break the code, shed a little light on the bitch clicks inner life.  </p>

<p>Lauren Brown was waiting at my locker that morning. She was junior high perfection with no awkward phase in sight. She only had time for a few close friends; as she was always rushing off to her scheduled activities; figure skating, piano lessons, basketball practice; and she excelled at all of them. She'd stopped talking to me mid way through third grade when my hair turned frizzy, so I was surprised to see her. </p>

<p>Her thin lips twitched as she said, "I started a club called the Fab-four, and we’re thinking of adding a fifth,” she was swinging her trapper keeper at her side, “There’s a sleepover tonight at my house to see if you’re it. Can you come?" </p>

<p>"Ok. Yeah." In fifth grade, I was not so much for opening my mouth when I spoke. I wanted to remain invisible and I was always seeking out corners to hide in, “I can come.” I surprised myself with that response. What would I talk to these girls about? At home I made my family laugh by repeating impressions I’d seen on Saturday Night Live, but my sister, Sheridan, had assured me this was not appropriate behavior in public. The truth was I very rarely said words that didn’t belong to others. I spent my time quoting tv shows, and the Babysitter Club novels. </p>

<p>"Don't you have to ask your mom?", Lauren peered at me suspiciously. Her parents knew where she was at all times because of her schedule, or at least they thought they did. (What they didn’t know was that she would ditch school to meet this boy from the south side of Evanston, who wore eyeliner and smoked pot; AND that she kept a ziplock bag of candy under her mattress since she was not allowed sweets.) </p>

<p>My mom, however, was never actually home due to her new love of Reggae and the men who came with it, so I was free to come and go as I pleased, but I was always home. "No, she doesn't care if I go, it's cool.”  </p>

<p>"Alright,” she said looking at me sideways,”just remember, just because you come to the first meeting doesn't mean you're in.”, She twisted around on her toes and clanked the long row of dangling combination locks as she walked away leaving me standing alone and freaked out. </p>

<p>I knew what she meant my round belly and hand-me-down pants didn't lend themselves to invitations. She wanted information about Sheridan and the Bitch Click, and I really didn’t have any, but I knew where to get it. </p>

<p>In the room that Sheridan and I shared there was a thin wide closet with wooden fold out doors, and in that closet there was a chipped white formica dresser, and in the top drawer of that dresser were my sister’s C cup bras (she was so the first to develop), and underneath her bras were these two hello Kitty pencils crossed unevenly over her diary. I had opened that drawer many many times, practiced lifting up the pencils and placing them back exactly the way I had found them. They were there so that she would know if  I’d been snooping--cause they were always placed exactly the same way. The diary was pink with white bubble hearts and it had a built in lock that needed a flimsy key to open it... well a key or a pointy knife. The latch of the diary was this silver circle and if you lifted it up, stuck the knife underneath and tilted it to the left the diary would pop open. I could pick just about any lock because my dad was a criminal and he’d taught me to break into cars and houses so a diary was small potatoes. </p>

<p>I had never actually read the diary though. Believe me I was dying to know what was in it but I could never bring myself read the stories that I’d hoped Sheridan would tell me. She was like my hero, our parents weren’t really around that much, and she had stepped in, just a year and a half older, and had been like a mom and a best friend. We’d always had this thing where we never cried at the same time because one of us had to be brave for the other, so we’d take turns. When I’d cry she’d put her arms around me and tell me it was going to be ok, and that’d she’d take care of it. And when she cried--actually, I couldn’t remember the last time that she’d cried, I guess lately she’d been been giving up her turn a lot. </p>

<p>The last time I had cried though, was a few months before, I’d been sitting in the back of my social studies classroom, slumping from fear, as I had watched each student in my row hand off a beige text book and read a paragraph out loud about Native American manhood rituals. I was next to read as the book worked it’s way back to my corner, I was nervous, but relieved that the teacher wasn’t asking us any questions. All I had to do was read what was already there, and just as Brian Jacover--the boy I had had a crush on since kindergarten-- handed me the book there was a pounding on the classroom door. I dropped the book right on Brian and my stomach flipped to see my dad--shifting wild-eyed searching for me through it’s glass window. My dad’s kinda big you know, like he can bench press 400 pounds kind of big. I used to call him the black incredible hulk. I recognized the look he had in his eyes. When my dad got high he’d get real paranoid that someone was going to take his kids, so he’d show up at sleepovers and at dances ready to drag us off and hide us away. We were kinda famous for it, but this was the first time he’d come to school. </p>

<p>As the teacher rushed to the door and started to open it my dad pushed it into her knocking her over, Sheridan just stood in the doorway behind him blank faced squeezing her backpack in front of her, as my Dad pressed in between the tiny rows of desks until he got to me grabbed my wrist and pulled me up. </p>

<p>“We goin’ let’s go.” he exploded  </p>

<p>My teacher, Ms. Bird, a tall broad black woman, was the toughest teacher in the school, the kind that made kids cry, she’d made me cry more than once. She inserted herself between my dad and I without touching either one of us and tried to push my dad back with her words, forcing him to let go of me--and focus on her. </p>

<p>“Mr. Foster, can I help you? Have you been to the office to check in?” </p>

<p>“I don’t need no goddamned office. These are my kids and if I wanna take em I’ma take my motherfuckin’ kids.” he spat the words into her face and she dropped back knocking into me. </p>

<p>Ms. Bird  raised her voice to match my father’s and was starting to shake, “ Your language is..., “she searched for the word, “...inappropriate, You cannot come into my... classroom and, and...” She was clearly afraid of him and I’d never seen her be afraid of anybody.  </p>

<p>“And what?”, my dad challenged. “and what?” he held her gaze until she started to cry--and then he gave me the--get your ass over here--look. </p>

<p>I slid around my teacher and past my dad over to my sister’s side looking to see if she was crying, but she was stoic. She turned to me looking the three inches down to my eyes and slightly moved her head from side to side trying to tell me not here, don’t do it here, but I couldn’t help it. My eyes got wet and before I knew it my cheeks were soaked.  I waited for Sheridan to put her arm around me, but in the doorway of my classroom, with the kid’s watching and my teacher broken, she didn’t say anything and she took a step away from me and gave me a look that belonged to my father. It was hard and private. She’s disappointed I thought, but when I looked closer, she looked like she didn’t feel anything at all. </p>

<p>And after that, we stopped talking...about everything. The dark lipstick happened, the bitch click happened And now when I asked her for advice about the boys I had crushes on, or about what was ok to talk about at the lunch table--she’d just ignore me. My parent not really being around, I could take that, but man--my sister not talking to me, that was killer. </p>

<p>I started to think of the fab-four sleep over as my chance to finally know her again, more then that, to prove to the other kids that I knew her. I shoved the knife and the diary into my generic forest green back pack, ignored the part of my brain that was trying to warn me Sheridan would be home soon, and walked to Lauren’s. </p>

<p>Lauren’s mom had this silver buzz cut and her dad was kinda lanky and nerdy. They greeted me in that--overly nice feel bad for this kid--kind of way; and told me the girls were all upstairs. </p>

<p>When I walked into her room there were three sleeping bags laid out on the floor, two bright pink and one She-ra. The girls had already started digging into Lauren’s candy stash and there tongues were all bright green from the lick’m’aid sticks. Lauren’s guinea pig was squealing from his cage. They all looked at me both annoyed and interested and, not knowing what to say, instead of speaking, I pulled out the diary. </p>

<p>“What’s that?” Lauren asked, popping up onto her knees expectantly. </p>

<p>“It’s Sheridan’s.” I said, kinda proud like. </p>

<p>All the girls jumped up and down on their knees and screeched a chorus of “NO WAYS” and “SHUT UPS” </p>

<p>“Yup!” I said feeling more and more confident. I flipped opened the lock and let the other girls huddle around me as I read. </p>

<p>“Dear Diary, I lent one of my bra’s to Suzie D. today. She’s gonna stuff it with socks tomorrow and see if any of the boys notice.”  I looked up from the page--just as the girls leaned in. I flipped ahead. I had them and was pretty sure it got better then this.” </p>

<p>“Dear Diary,” I read again for effect, “ I got my period today right in the middle of history and it sucked sucked SUCKED,” The girls started to look at each other searching to see if anyone else had gotten their period yet, it was clear that they hadn’t.  </p>

<p>I was blowing there mind, and I had to keep going. I flipped through until the word love jumped off the page.</p>

<p>“Dear Diary, I think I’m in love. Mikey is sooo hot and I freakin’ love his butt in those jeans.” </p>

<p>“Mikey”, I explained, “Is our cousin, Justin, from Wisconsin’s BEST friend. We just went to visit them. And stayed up all night playing poker it was very cool. Mickey taught me how to shuffle and I can totally teach you.” I was talking way more then I ever did, and feeling pretty awesome even though I had no idea that my sister had a thing for Mikey. I thought he was like a big brother type. I kept reading. </p>

<p>“Last night Mikey and I were in Justin’s room and he turned off the lights and told me I was the hottest girl he’d ever seen. And then he kissed me, tongue and all.” That part grossed me out, because I hadn’t even thought about kissing boys yet let alone tasting their tongue, but the girls loved it. It was just like the sleepover scene in Grease where they all gush and throw pillows. I carried on. “He told he loved me...” the girls giggled again, “and even though I’d never done it before, we had sex.” </p>

<p>I said it out loud before it reached my brain. I just told all the girls in the room that Sheridan wasn’t a virgin anymore; a possibility that I had never considered. I stopped reading and couldn’t speak, but nobody noticed. They were to busy pouncing on this juicy information. I had produced a bit of gossip that no one had expected. We couldn’t even say sex yet without losing it in a cloud of laughter. But I had said it clear as day and there was no going back. </p>

<p>On Monday the story spread through out the hallways. By first period, everybody was talking about it.  I stood across from Sheridan’s classroom. I figured, I’d humiliated her I’d give her the chance to humiliate me. She walked out perfectly pressed as always, came within a foot of me, and walked by, I waited for her to call me a name or even hit me, but she didn’t even acknowledge me not a word or a look. I think because she knew; that was what would hurt me the most. The fab-four surrounded me, at my back just like the bitch click stood by Sheridan’s.  </p>

<p>“You’re in.”, Lauren said, “Welcome to the fab-five, and don’t worry about your sister. She’ll get over it. Everybody knew anyway. We could just tell.” </p>

<p>Really, I thought, cause I couldn’t tell. I would have given anything to look at my sister and to know her.  </p>
