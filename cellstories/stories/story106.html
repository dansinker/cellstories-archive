<h2>Listen to the Street</h2>
	<h3>Kio Stark</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>It's dusk on a Friday night, and the rain is coming. There's a man, unsteady on his feet, with a long, curled-handle umbrella. He's holding it up to his shoulder like a machine gun, staring down the barrel and swiveling like a jungle commando, catching his image in the scratched plexiglass window of the bodega. I wonder if the yellowed, dust-refracted reflection suits his idea of himself better than a harsh mirror. A small boy wanders out of the store and stands a few feet away, watching. The man pivots slowly, beginning to grunt and growl before he comes around to face the boy. The boy pulls his arms around himself and waits to see where this is going. So do I. The man hunkers down and grunts his way toward the boy, the umbrella-gun carefully aimed. I'm weighing my slightness against the man's new equilibrium. In case. Then, something invisible passes between them and the tension breaks. The boy giggles and runs behind a tree, peeking out. The man pulls a 40oz out of a pocket and sits down on the bodega steps. The evening begins. </p>

<p>     In the projects, people are milling around, winding up to things that come later. There's a butter-colored Cadillac parked out front. The door sits open and the song on the radio drifts out into the air. There's a man sitting in the car with his feet on the curb. He's wearing one of those old man caps, and seems old enough to have earned it. He sings past the volume of the radio, his voice fluid, with just a little gravel in it. I smile at him, and he tips his hat. “That's right, baby,” he says and meets up with the song again on a high, trailing note. </p>

<p>     A few blocks away a man is leaning back against the side of his sedan, one arm stretched out above the door as though the car were his best girl. There's a mambo playing, and all around the other men are lifting beers swaddled in brown paper and shimmying in place, their heads thrown back with pleasure. Now he reaches into his pocket and scatters a handful of bright pennies in the empty street. A few small children rush over at the sound of the fallen coins, squatting to gather them. He watches with pride at what he has caused. The other men keep dancing in place as the song changes key. </p>

<p>     The corner boys are practicing footwork with invisible basketballs, pivoting around each other. One takes a jumpshot and his gaze follows it up to the shining moon. "Yo," he says, "is the moon a planet?" He's looking at the smallest of the boys, the wiry one who must be the answer man among them. Answer Man says, "The moon's name is Maria." </p>

<p>     There’s a girl, I haven't seen her since midsummer. Now she comes through her front door. Something has changed. She has grown into herself. She has become enticing. She stretches and yawns, and takes her time settling down to sit on the top step. She tips her head one way, and then the other. What she is not doing is fidgeting. What she is not doing is posing. What she is not doing is waiting. After a while the boys come slowly out of the dark, one by one. They sit at her feet and ignore each other. She gives the street an idle scan. Minutes pass. Nobody says a word. </p>

<p>     When I get back home, there are flashing lights all around, ambulances and idling rigs. The firemen lumber under the weight of their gear. People on corners are spreading the news. Something has happened and these are the artifacts left behind by the thing that happened. EMTs lean around an empty gurney on a pathway. Whatever went wrong has been taken away. In the middle of the lawn, one man in flannel pajamas and a do-rag stands and counts a handful of change. </p>

<p>     Now it’s early. I’m squinting in the brightness. A man is sitting on an upturned milk crate, drinking coffee from a mug. He raises it in greeting. The incongruity of the street perch and the kitchen cup pull a grin out of me. He shakes his head. "A man could look at a smile like that for the rest of his life," he says. I stop a moment. I like the look of this one. He's got some Cherokee around the eyes, a lullaby voice, the rangy arms of a swimmer. He rocks a little on the milk crate, then holds out the mug. "Want a sip?" I'm late for work, the air is thick as a swamp. I laugh, and keep walking. </p>

<p>    Every time I come down here, something else is gone. This morning a man with a fine-boned face and an untucked shirt walks toward me, his arm angled out like a dandy's. He comes closer and I see that he's been crying in a dry and quiet way as he walks, the face quivering and the eyes ringed red. Up close the cocked arm seems to be holding him up, no longer a flourish. It's so early in the morning, it all bespeaks heartbreak. A final night, a last, fumbling exit, a sorrow that sinks like a stone. </p>

<p>     I've never been down this street before. Everyone here is maimed somehow. A pimply girl shuffles along, her head tipping back like a narcoleptic, she is nodding on something, coming unwound with each step. There's a man dragging his leg along behind him like an unwanted burden. Then a skinny guy in hightops with breasts bouncing under his t-shirt rushes into one of the doorways. A round woman who guides her electric wheelchair with flipper limbs whirs past an old man with a bandage around his neck like an ascot. An elegant woman with upswept hair and three fingers in a claw-shaped cast is telling a story to no one. Then the nodding girl doubles back, tucks herself into the shade of a ghetto palm and gives in to the sleep that she can't outrun. </p>

<p>     Later, there are six antsy cops guarding the corners against some sinister potential I can't perceive. The kids have been sprung for the day, milling around on the sidewalks. Somehow they've all grown great pillows of fat since I saw them last, it spills out of their tight clothes, and now their bodies take up as much of the sidewalk as their voices. 
<br>     Around the corner on a sidestreet, some girls are jumping double dutch, thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump, “Ice cream soda pop cherries on top / how many boyfriends do you got?" </p>

<p>     When I come out of the subway into the close of the day, a tall guy says to me, "You're a beautiful lady, you just made my day walkin' by here."</p>

<p>      Little guy crossing the street says, "Mine too."</p>

<p>      Tall guy calls out to him, "Right? You work all day, you deserve to see something beautiful."</p>

<p>      Little guy says, "It's like the icing." </p>

<p>     There's a couple arguing. His voice breaks like a boy's as he says, "Yeah, and what exactly did you do about it?" She stands silent, her head tipped away from him, chin askew. There's nothing so impassable about her, but you can tell she's going to win. </p>

<p>     Two men are walking, side by side. The smaller one is lightly holding the other’s backpack strap. Just that. </p>

<p>     Out in front of the gallery in the soft, misty rain, people are smoking and talking with their hands. A very small woman in a curvy black dress is standing alone with her arms crossed, shiny black curls swinging around her bare shoulders. My friend says hello to her, and then I do too, it's a friendly night, here in the rain. She seems both relieved and dismayed to have been noticed as a person who is waiting for something. I ask her why she's standing around. </p>

<p>      "My friend is very very late," she tells me, her shoulders rise and drop, punctuating her annoyance. She holds a palm up to the rain. She's tapping her foot. She's smiling through all of this. She's performing something. </p>

<p>      "You could wait inside," I say, pointing at the massive plate glass windows that separate us from the party. </p>

<p>      "Oh no," she says. "I want to stay here and get even madder by the time he shows up." </p>

<p>      Now I get it. Now I'm interested. "What are you going to say when he does?" </p>

<p>      She gives me a look that says, we're in this together, we women, we know how this works, we know where the power lies. "I'm going to tell him," she leans closer, "that he better buy me a drink before I'll even say a word to him." </p>

<p>      We both laugh, and she whisks some of the dewdrops off her pretty arms. A taxi pulls up, a man in a nice shirt and nice shoes tumbles out. He seems earnest even in the way he unfolds himself from the taxi, eager and clumsy. It's not what I expected at all. I look back at her, she winks at me as he brushes past me to greet her. </p>

<p>     Over my shoulder, I can hear her. She's not mad at all. </p>
