<h2>A Little Grove of Trees</h2>
	<h3>Alex Coates</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>Ashton has found a refrigerator and she wants to be shut inside it. She’s writing a story, she says, about a girl who suffocates in a little landfill when she falls into a fridge.  I’ve heard of this problem. </p>

<p>      Ashton’s a writer.  She likes problems.  I’m an inventor.  I like solutions. </p>

<p>      We both pack notebooks.  It will be dark inside the fridge, so Ashton also packs a small tape recorder.  It takes her half an hour to drive us to the empty little field in the middle of nowhere, and then we have to park on the shoulder of the road, car nine-tenths into a drainage ditch, and walk.  At the edge of the property there is a little grove of trees.  In the middle of the grove is a clearing, and in this clearing is a pile of garbage.  There’s a pile of old tires, and a car door with its window smashed out.  There are rusting steel barrels half filled with dirt, and shredded black trash bags spilling compost.  There are twisted sheets of metal, orange, and lengths of red wire, and there in the middle is the refrigerator, lying on its side.</p>

<p>      “Okay, Tom,” she says to me.  “Help me roll this thing over.” 
<br>      We get it so that the fridge door opens to the sky, and Ashton climbs in.  She requests my jacket first.  The inside of the fridge is filthy.  It’s also dry, luckily, but there are black, oily looking stains where it wasn’t.  They look sticky and rough with dried grit.</p>

<p>      “You’re lucky I brought my work jacket,” I tell her.  It’s the one missing a button on the collar, and with the right cuff that’s got the stitching singed off.  She sits in the fridge and looks over the sides.  I think of a picture I saw once of a puppy in a life raft.  I want to put my hand in her hair, which is brown like the leaves, and which I think must feel softer than I can imagine.  This is why I will be a good inventor.  I can imagine things I can’t imagine.</p>

<p>      Ashton is jotting down notes.  What it is like to be inside a refrigerator.  I take a slow lap around the thing, looking it over.  Once the door is closed, how do you get it open?  Once the seal is set, how might it break? </p>

<p>      “Okay,” she says, “close it.”</p>

<p>      She lays down, legs pressed together and crooked.  I close the door slowly, in case part of her is sticking out.  I don’t want to slam a knee.  I have these visions sometimes that she’s an android, made just for me.  Sealing her into a box isn’t helping with that.</p>

<p>      I feel the spongy seal against my fingertips.  I pause with the door open a fraction of an inch to say, “Here goes,” and I let it drop shut.  Everything is quiet.  I get out my notebook and begin to make another lap. </p>

<p>      After a minute I realize I can hear Ashton talking into her tape recorder.  At least I think that’s what she’s doing, but I yell at her to make sure.</p>

<p>      “Are you okay in there?”</p>

<p>      “Yes!” she shouts back.</p>

<p>      I am concerned about safety.  “Do you need me to open the door?”</p>

<p>      “No!”</p>

<p>      You could rig a rope attached to the door that ran through a hole in the side.  The hole would have to be insulated somehow, but then if you were trapped you could pull the rope and open the door.  Well, maybe you couldn’t.  The angle’s not very good.  What you’d really need is a lever.  Or a small jack, somewhere near the door, which you could pump and pump until it pushed the door open enough to crack the seal.  Yes, a jack might do it.  A jack might be just the thing.</p>

<p>      I knock on the side of the fridge.  Ashton knocks back. 
<br>      I don’t know why it surprises me when she lets herself out.  She pops free like a roll of ready-to-bake biscuits, blinking into the daylight.  Not sunlight, really, since we’re in a grove and the sky is overcast, but daylight.  Enough to make her wince.</p>

<p>      “What have you learned?” I ask.</p>

<p>      “It would be a horrible way to die,” she tells me.  “But I need one more favor.”</p>

<p>      “What?”</p>

<p>      “Sit on the door,” she says.  “Sit on it so I can’t get out.  I want to feel what it’s like to panic.”</p>

<p>      I want to say, just ask me, because suddenly I’m panicking myself.  She wants me to sit on top of a refrigerator door while she hits and kicks at it beneath me, suffocating and frightened, and I’m meant to be okay with it.  We ask too much of each other.  I want to put my hand in her hair, and kiss her cheek, and I want to smell leaves and dirt when I breathe her in.  But I’m too cowardly to ask for a trade like that.</p>

<p>      “Okay,” I tell her. “Climb back in.”</p>

<p>      But she holds up a finger, and that’s when I realize how hard she’s breathing. She must already be afraid.  When she popped free, she was already desperate for air. </p>

<p>      One thing no one knows about except Ashton is my perpetual motion machine. I just need to find the right kind of matter. That’s been the hard part.  But when I do, this is how it will work: a quantity of liquid matter is poured over a large paddlewheel.  As it melts, the wheel will turn and generate energy.  The energy is used to heat the matter into a gas, which rises up the device and above the paddle wheel, where it again condenses and again turns the wheel.</p>

<p>      Water won’t work, or hasn’t yet.  It is too expensive, energetically.  I need something that straddles the line between liquid and gas at room temprature.  I have yet to find it.</p>

<p>      Ashton thinks it is brilliant. When she sells her novel, she tells me, she will pay for me to do research. I will find the right kind of matter, and then I will sell my machine, and the two of us will have money and each other, because we were close already before we got rich.  We can both be trusted. </p>

<p>      I feel Ashton pushing away beneath me, but it’s all very tentative.  She’s gauging my weight right now.  What she isn’t doing is panicking.  I adjust myself, leaning from one side to another. To calm myself down, I try to think of this as a science problem.  Is it more efficient to sit on the door, or to lay on top of it?  Is it better to have my weight on a single point, or more evenly distributed?  So far this is working.  So far I’m keeping my cool. 
<br>      I asked her, when we parked, how, exactly, she found this refrigerator.  It’s a little in the middle of nowhere, I told her.  I’m not criticizing, but this is the truth.</p>

<p>      “I explored,” she said.  “I found the fridge first, and then came the story.  That’s how it works when you write.  You observe everything without knowing why, and hope something comes out of it.”</p>

<p>      “Then it’s like inventing,” I said.  “But that doesn’t explain what you were doing out here in the first place.  It doesn’t explain how you found this little grove of trees in a little field of corn off a little dirty road that’s never bothered to be named.”</p>

<p>      “Just luck,” said Ashton.</p>

<p>      “That’s not a very satisfying answer,” I told her.</p>

<p>      “You don’t get a satisfying answer.  What you get is to shut me in a refrigerator and invent a way out.” </p>

<p>      Now she’s panicking.</p>

<p>      I can tell, because she’s making all these noises that aren’t words, and because she’s gone beyond kicking the door. She’s kicking the door and rocking, like maybe she can roll the fridge over and it will just spill her out.  What works best, it turns out, is to lie down flat. She almost bounced me off when I was just sitting.</p>

<p>      The fridge is starting to rock underneath me, but if I’ve kept my balance it isn’t on purpose.  I don’t think I can move.  I’m looking at the sky, and I’m trying to think of a problem to solve.  If she calmed down, I think I could too.  I want to think that she will.  I want to think that she knows I’d never let her get hurt.  No matter what I can create, I’ll never invent a single hair that feels as soft as hers. Even if I built an entire android, perfect in every other way, its awful hair is how I’d never forget that it wasn’t really her.</p>
