<h2>Flight</h2>

		</p><p>My roommate had the idea for the event. He got a few people together and as a collective they planned it, started the Facebook group and sent out the invitations. They went out three weeks in advance. By the day of, there were 206 Attendings, 286 Maybes, 180 Declined, and 500 Haven't Responded.</p>

<p>  One of the organizers had located an abandoned car manufacturing plant, a little bit northwest of the Junction. It was a lot farther than most of us usually got out to, but they'd thought of that: the event page included all the TTC info necessary and even told us the least hilly street to go up if we were on a bike (Bathurst).</p>

<p>  That afternoon my friend Sam texted me: “You going tonight?”</p>

<p>  “Yeah,” I texted. “I'm gonna work for a while and then prob go late.”</p>

<p>  “I'm hosting a festival thing,” he said on the phone later in the day. “I gotta drop off my guitar then I'll meet you around 11:30?”</p>

<p>  “What was the festival?” I said when he showed up at my door.</p>

<p>  “It was like a South Asian cultural thing.” He accepted my bottle of wine. “I was the host.”</p>

<p>  “Cool,” I said. “That's cool.”</p>

<p>  We decided to take the TTC. Waiting for the bus at Eglinton West Station there were like fifty other people going to the same thing, one guy who I knew.</p>

<p>  “I'm starting an art supply store out this way, actually,” he said on the bus. “I don't know anything about business, but this friend of mine does. I just went to art school, you know.”</p>

<p>  “Cool,” I said. “Did you grow up around here?”</p>

<p>  “Yeah, well, in Mississauga.”</p>

<p>  “Yeah,” I said. “That's pretty cool.”</p>

<p>  The bus stopped under a bridge and most of the bus got off. At least a hundred people were milling around outside, and at least a hundred more were inside the building, probably more like two or three hundred.</p>

<p>  “Okay,” my roommate said, standing on a stage and speaking into a microphone. The mic squealed feedback. The room was enormous and painted like a basketball court. It was long-abandoned. Everything was covered in graffiti and the floors were covered in puddles and broken glass and all along one wall was old rusted machinery. It was dark and we stepped in a lot of water. “How is everyone feeling?” my roommate said. “Does everyone feel like flying?”</p>

<p>  The crowd cheered.</p>

<p>  “I said, does everyone feel like flying or what???” He shouted with a huge smile. “Did you guys come here to party or an did you come here to FLY???”</p>

<p>  “FLY!” we shouted back.</p>

<p>  “I said did you come here to get drunk, flirt with pretty boys and girls, see some crazy art, or did you come here to fly into the sky????”</p>

<p>  Everyone shouted that they were definitely here to fly.</p>

<p>  “Okay! Let's do it then! Let's fly into the air!”</p>

<p>  The band behind him played about thirty seconds of all-out noise and then all the instruments quieted down and came together into a steady, tense beat. The other organizers came out onto the stage. They stood in a line facing us at the front of the stage.</p>

<p>  “You guys ready?” my roommate said to the others from the middle of the line. He looked left and right, up and down the row. “Are we gonna do this thing?” he said, soft and mysterious; the band kept the beat.</p>

<p>  They did the thing. My roommate was first. He set the microphone at his feet, did a funny sort of wriggly dance, and then slowly, slowly, began to rise. “Heck yes!” he shouted, without the mic, but we could all still hear him. “Woooooooooowwwweeeeee! Wooooooooooooooooo!”</p>

<p>  He was about ten feet above the stage. Hovering.</p>

<p>  Then he started towards us—out past the edge of the stage, over our heads.</p>

<p>  “Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!” he said. He stopped right in the middle of the gymnasium, centered between the tiered rows of small square windows that lined the very tops of the back and side walls, and swung around in place to face the others on the stage, still hovering at about fifty feet up. “Are you guys coming or what?”</p>

<p>  They were. In a wavering, unsteady row, but more or less all at once, they lifted off the stage. Some rose only a few inches at first; one girl rose very slowly and then shot straight up about twenty feet. Some got into a lotus position before they started. Some of them, once in the air, kicked their legs back and forth as if treading water. Another guy I lived with at the time did it by doing the actions of jumping-jacks. A girl I had gone out with a few times about a year before twisted her body around so that she spiraled head-first as she rose. A guy with whom I was in a book club but who I'd never talked to did a funny shoulder-shrugging. Most of them were just wearing their street clothes, but one girl, an artist well-known in this crowd, wore a flesh-toned body suit with two black dildos at her crotch. She stroked them as she flew and she was propelled a little with each jerk.</p>

<p>  Eventually they all made it to where my roommate was, in the center of the gym, directly over our heads. At first they formed a loose, bobbing cluster, but then, seemingly on some prearranged signal, they spread out into a circle about fifty feet across, all holding hands.</p>

<p>  They looked at each other.</p>

<p>  “Ready?” my roommate asked them.</p>

<p>  “Ready!” they shouted.</p>

<p>  They started to spin. It started slow, with them all flying in their own funny ways, but then they kind of toned down the idiosyncrasies and became more like a team. The circle sped up. Their legs began to pull away from them, out and away from the circle, and we could see them grasping each other's hands more tightly. Someone's shoe flew off and smacked one of the square window panes with a brittle clatter, and some people on the ground laughed uneasily. They sped up even more.</p>

<p>  “Weeeeeeeeee!” my roommate shouted, but he was so out of breath it barely came out. “Weeoww!” someone else in the circle called out, but it seemed forced. After that they were all silent and seemed to concentrate fiercely as they sped up so much that their speed created a low modulating whistle, and we were silent too. 
<br> 
<br>“I kind of thought we were all gonna fly,” I said to no one in particular in someone's basement, later that night. A bong was being passed around.</p>

<p>  “Yeah, me too,” said one girl. “I thought he meant all of us, the way he was talking.”</p>

<p>  “It sounded like that, yeah.”</p>

<p>  “And on the event page too.”</p>

<p>  “Do you guys think it was real?” asked the guy with the bong.</p>

<p>  “I think I can fly,” another girl said. She had tight curly hair.</p>

<p>  I didn't know these people that well. I really only knew the one girl who had invited me into the taxi, and even her not so much. I looked around the room. “Me too,” I said. “I think I could do that.”</p>

<p>  For some reason we all decided to use the lotus position way, even though at the event that had obviously been only one of many ways to do it. We were self-conscious though, and it seemed the least pretentious.</p>

<p>  Somehow I became the leader, and we decided that there should be a countdown for us all to do it at the same time. Just as we got in position though, Sam and another guy burst in with a magnum of wine, laughing about catching the bus in the wrong direction. We told them what was up and gave them a few minutes to get in the right mood. Sam's friend couldn't or didn't want to do the lotus, which was okay, since most of us were just crossing our legs anyway, but instead he just lay down on the low table in the middle of the room, his big belly poking out of his t-shirt.</p>

<p>  “Okay?” The curly-haired girl said. She sat directly across from me and we looked at each other over the belly. We were the leaders together.</p>

<p>  “Three,” we counted.</p>

<p>  “Two.”</p>

<p>  “Marcel—Marcel.” It was Sam. “I...” he couldn't talk. He was laughing too hard, trying not to choke on his wine. “Just one second.” Some of the others were now laughing too. “Gehhh,” said the kid with the bong, holding it to the guy's belly and shaking violently as if he were being electrocuted by it, cracking up.</p>

<p>  “Gehhhhhhhhhhhh.”</p>

<p>  One of the girls was crying. The curly-haired girl comforted her. “Shhh,”  she soothed. “You don't have to.”</p>

<p>  She led the crying girl upstairs and returned alone a few minutes later. “Didn't want to fly,” she said. “She's asleep now.”</p>

<p>  “Let's FLY!!!” the guy on the table said, waking up.</p>

<p>  “Don't you guys think we should put some music on?” said Sam. “What's good to flyyy to?”</p>

<p>  Everyone started talking about what music would be good to fly to.</p>

<p>  The curly-haired girl and I looked at each other. 
<br> 
<br>I told her I had never really been able to double, and that was true, but somehow there I was, standing and peddling her bike while she sat on the seat behind me.</p>

<p>  “I forgot how intimate this was,” I said.</p>

<p>  “Consider it foreplay.”</p>

<p>  We were passing the park at Carleton and Parliament when I heard my name.</p>

<p>  “Marcellllllllll!”</p>

<p>  An old friend from high school, sitting on a bench alone in the night. He tried to get us to drink his homemade wine with him. I didn't really want to stop but I needed a break anyway so we stopped just for a second.</p>

<p>  “Did you see those fucking guys flying?” he said. He was really drunk.</p>

<p>  I looked at the curly-haired girl but she looked past me.</p>

<p>  “Yeah,” she said. “Totally. Can I have some wine?”</p>

<p>  “Fuck yes,” he said.</p>

<p>  We ended up all sitting on the bench. Curly-hair in the middle.</p>

<p>  “I used to fly like that,” my old friend was saying.</p>

<p>  “Really?” said the curly-haired girl.</p>

<p>  “What?” I said. “What are you talking about?”</p>

<p>  “What what? I used to fly like a whore.”</p>

<p>  “No you didn't.”</p>

<p>  “I did.”</p>

<p>  I couldn't take it. Curly-hair was believing him.</p>

<p>  “Adam there's no fucking way you used to fly. Like without any... like on your own power? What the fuck are you talking about?”</p>

<p>  I meant to sound jokey but I was drunker than I thought. The curly-haired girl gave me a look like I was the asshole. “Why couldn't he?” she said.</p>

<p>  My old friend looked at me with laughter in his drunk, stupid eyes. 
<br> 
<br>I left them there on the bench together. The sun was half-up now and I felt dead on the sidewalk. The bike belonged to the girl so I walked back towards the west end, waiting around for a few minutes at each streetcar stop but then moving on, impatient. I was almost sober and badly needed water.</p>

<p>  My roommate, the same one from earlier, from the event, was up in the kitchen when I got back, making eggs for himself and his girlfriend.</p>

<p>  “Do you believe in reincarnation,” he asked me.</p>

<p>  I collapsed on the couch.</p>

<p>  “I want to know what it feels like,” he said, shaking the pan around in circles over the stove.</p>

<p>  My head hurt so bad I had to shut my eyes. I could hear the grease spitting everywhere. The sink's water was only a step away but I couldn't get up, and for some reason I didn't feel like I could ask my roommate for a glass.</p>

<p>  I opened my eyes and, blocking the overhead fluorescence with my fingers, looked at his socked feet in the dirt by the stove. He turned and saw me looking at him.</p>

<p>  “Don't you?” he said.</p>
