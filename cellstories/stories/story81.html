<h2>Eurail</h2>
	<h3>J.D. Smith</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>Living on next to nothing, like a bromeliad, I traveled Europe on trains among other students. I slept on overnight routes to save money on lodging and drank, then sweated out, countless liters of water from ribbed and Art Deco plastic bottles; what came from the restroom faucets wasn’t potable. Off the train, I saw enough of the Continent to recall a detail, or nod knowingly, among similarly traveled peers who might be in a position to offer me work, or sex.</p>

<p>      Between Thessaloniki and Istanbul I even met the one obnoxious Canadian in captivity. When I returned from the floor-level latrine he was sitting in my compartment in place of the Greek whose earphones had spilled out Led Zeppelin in a whisper. Before I could slide the door closed and take refuge behind the Herald Tribune he looked straight at me.</p>

<p>      “Hi. You speak English, don’t you?”</p>

<p>      I nodded, but didn’t get to elaborate.</p>

<p>      “Great. You looked like you did. I hope you don’t mind that I put your backpack up in the rack. I might have done you a favor, though. It’s heavy, and you’re not a very big guy.”</p>

<p>      He leaned across the compartment to right my bottle of water, and my hopes of catching up on the baseball scores rose. They fell as he raised the window and lit a Rothman.</p>

<p>      “I’m sorry, I should have introduced myself.”</p>

<p>      I insisted there was no need, but the protest failed.</p>

<p>        “I am Jack DuMonde. That’s French for ‘of the world’—the DuMonde part, not Jack. I come to Europe about once a year.”</p>

<p>      He pronounced “about” as “a boat.” I could only wonder why he had not been kept in his understated home and native land as a cautionary example; the Spartans had once appointed village drunks as a warning to the young.</p>

<p>      Jack took a deep puff and resumed.</p>

<p>      “Where are you going?”</p>

<p>      “Istanbul. I’m going to see the Hagia Sophia.”</p>

<p>      “It’s a shame how the government has let it get run down, but you should still see it.</p>

<p>      “I hope that’s not all you see, though.”  He leaned forward as if to take me by the shoulders, and could have if I hadn’t flattened against the backrest. “Listen. We’re both men. There are things we can talk about." We were alone, but he lowered his voice. “You’ve got to go to a little district on the Asian side called Iti Buçuk. Suck indeed, let me tell you. It’s amazing what you can get for only a few dollars.”</p>

<p>      I hadn’t lowered or raised the newspaper. He took a breath before continuing.</p>

<p>      “I know I’m going on a bit. It’s an occupational hazard when you’re in communications. Do you know anything about the field?”</p>

<p>      I was cornered.</p>

<p>      “Yes, but not very much.”</p>

<p>      He took my assent for fascination. Through fields, terraced hills, and interchangeable villages of plaza and church I learned about ratings, market shares, quarterly earnings. Syndication rights and production values. What he communicated did not come up. The outrageous demands of advertisers did, and the paucity of good restaurants on his stretch of Yonge Street; expense account meals on the road made up for it.</p>

<p>      Several, quite a few, stops later, as we passed one of the last minarets in Greece, Jack asked what I did. He took note, briefly, and said one of his staff had a background in international relations like me. The young man could never quite make the transition from academic abstractions to the practical realm of completing assignments. He would have to be let go after Jack returned to Toronto.</p>

<p>      His last cigarette took us from the arid foothills to the swamps of Thrace. He opened the window and tossed out the butt.</p>

<p>      “I’ve never seen the need for those signs. ‘It is dangerous to lean out.’ Of course it’s dangerous to lean out. How stupid do they think people are?”</p>

<p>      “It can’t be too dangerous,” I said. “Unless you climb up on something you can’t get very far out.”</p>

<p>      There was a chance, however small, he would try, and I did not want to discourage him. It was a long way to Istanbul.</p>

<p>      At the last stop on the Greek side the government flexed its border control muscles to impress the Turks, inspecting passports in the compartments and primarily holding up the train. For two hours we had the opportunity to patronize the station shop, stocked with feta and fried chickpeas, or stand in the morning’s chill. Along the tracks an English student complained—at first to the uncomprehending conductors, then to no one in particular—that his girlfriend was sick. Another American, a blonde in khaki shorts, discussed her plan to travel alone in the Anatolian outback. Neither had a spare seat to offer.</p>

<p>      When I boarded for the short trip to the Turkish side, where the government would flex its border control muscles to impress the Greeks, Jack had not moved except to fold my newspaper inside-out and open the window, admitting a cloud of mosquitoes.</p>

<p>      He swatted one into a bloody paste on his forearm. “Damned mosquitoes. Maybe I should say damned kounoupis. That’s what the Greeks call them.” He stretched out the word a second time. “Kou-nou-pis. I don’t know what they’re called in Turkish.”</p>

<p>      A rose by any other name, though. The next one he fed might be malarial.</p>

<p>      It was still a long way to Istanbul, and the delay on the Turkish side was supposedly four hours. Now and then a German would have to open his bags, and sometimes a Canadian, but only after the Americans’ bags were checked, all of them. The occasional detained Yank kept the arms sales forthcoming and muted official complaints about Cyprus. The others were for practice.</p>

<p>      This reminded me of something I had forgotten; I nearly forgot again as Jack spoke.</p>

<p>      “Say, would you mind watching my things for a minute? I must have gotten a bad piece of moussaka—I’m nearly bent in two.”</p>

<p>      Outside my window, the fields of stooped farmers and grazing goats were luxurious with silence. If my books could have spoken, though, they would have shouted. Besides Hobbes, I was reviewing Thucydides to prepare for a fall seminar, and kept returning to the Melian Discourse. The Athenians offered the Melians a choice between peaceful surrender and annihilation as, in the world, the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must. People may choose to be one or the other, but the justice of their cause did not matter. For several hours I had made the wrong choice. Choosing again, I opened my backpack, then Jack's duffel bag.</p>

<p>      When he came back, much relieved, we sat statelessly, discussing the hole in the ozone layer and our favorite sites in Milan, and why the Canadians and Brits spelled “favorite” with a “u.” After we turned over our passports for examination Jack mentioned where he was going to stay and suggested I get a room there.</p>

<p>      I was refolding my newspaper when the gendarmes returned to our compartment.</p>

<p>      One asked the inevitable question.</p>

<p>      “American?”</p>

<p>      I nodded.</p>

<p>      “Luggage, please.”</p>

<p>      I pointed to the backpack and motioned for help. The taller officer took one end of the frame, and together we brought it down.</p>

<p>      Placid and bored, I watched him work through assorted packs and pouches. No Fourth Amendment protected me from his search, and no gloves protected him from three weeks of soiled clothes.</p>

<p>      He zipped the backpack, lifted it without my help and thanked me for my cooperation.</p>

<p>      His colleague turned to Jack.</p>

<p>      “American?”</p>

<p>      “No, Canadian.”</p>

<p>      The gendarme paused, then stated, “Luggage, please.”</p>

<p>      Jack brought down the duffel bag and opened it so quickly that the zipper shrieked. The gendarme casually fingered the clothing, then stopped, pulling out a plastic bag.</p>

<p>        “What is this?”</p>

<p>      “I don’t know. I’ve never seen it before.”</p>

<p>      The taller officer blocked the door.</p>

<p>        “Come with us, please.”</p>

<p>      The officers took him by either arm; the larger carried his duffel bag. As they elbowed the door open and walked out Jack looked over his shoulder. I saw confusion and fear.</p>

<p>      My journey with him, and with some of Amsterdam’s finer hashish, was done. I took out Thucydides and lit a Dunhill to ward off the kounoupis.</p>

<p>      Jack’s choice of lodging, a guest house on the European side, with Western toilets, turned out to be a bargain, though prices in Iti Buçuk had risen since his last visit. For two days I walked in and out of domed wonders and drank glass after small glass of tea with rug and leather merchants, and ate enough doughy rings of simit to have sleeved an arm in them.</p>

<p><h4>*</h4></p><p>None of this would matter if I had never seen him again, but after a decade, in which I had learned to live on tenure, and the smoke and mirrors of a theory on Third World politics, he appeared to me in Houston.</p>

<p>      Preparing to present a paper that opposed foreign aid, I surfed the channels in my hotel room and came across a newscast mentioning a book on, among other things, Turkish prisons—a latter-day <i>Midnight Express</i>.  In her professionally flat voice the interviewer introduced “our guest this morning, author Jack DuMonde.”</p>

<p>      His face was still round, if more wrinkled, and the words still streamed from it, but they were now “arrest” and “imprisonment” instead of “ratings” and “brothels.” He called the sentence more fortunate than his release. Jack had forgiven in his heart whoever had planted the drugs and now wanted to express his thanks. He’d had the opportunity to become a Christian, taking the road to Damascus in the exercise yard, at the rate of thirty minutes a week. The newsreader could stomach this no more than I could and went to break, noting that his book was moving up the Times best-seller list.</p>

<p>      I mashed the power button and tossed the remote control onto the bed. I had only needed to be rid of the man for a few hours to get some peace and quiet, and maybe a little sleep. Now I would have to hide from him and his gratitude in my own country, and if he wrote anything he talked there would be more books to come.</p>

<p>      On my way out I had a shot from the bottle of single malt on the nightstand; desperate times require desperate measures, and I needed steady nerves for my presentation. But the belt did nothing to dull an old craving that had just now returned. For all the money I spent and all the trouble I went through, and now this, whatever this was, I barely made a dent in that hash.</p>

<p>      I haven’t found any better.</p>
