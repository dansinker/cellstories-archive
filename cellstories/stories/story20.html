<h2>Last Day In Birmingham: A Twitter Itinerary</h2>
	<h3>Todd Dills</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>11:21 p.m.: which begins the day prior, sandwiched between columns of boxes.</p>

<p>11:24: after attempting to transmit via cell network, wonder whether one has jumped proverbial gun -- message is: network failure.</p>

<p>11:25: pack last glass. Tape box shut. Ponder missed opportunity. Vulcan moons. Barbecue forgone. The inability to explain finality to a child.</p>

<p>11:34: check network outages. Nothing. Drain beer and head for toothbrush. Outside: lightning, cars, thunder. Inside: boxes, trash.</p>

<p>11: 39: sleeping wife, other distractions from toothbrush: a plate that needs a box, a screwdriver. Hell is coat hangers, a wise woman once said.</p>

<p>11:46: say, "Hell is boxes."</p>

<p>11:47: back to toothbrush, this time in earnest -- examine coffee stains left by three years' worth of hour-long drives to office, scant dentistry.</p>

<p>11:53: note what little effect brushing actually has on stains.</p>

<p>11:54: scowl, spit. Network failure. Sleep.</p>

<p>6:50 a.m.: wake.</p>

<p>6:52: set coffee to cooking. Build box to contain coffee grinder, other last things.</p>

<p>7: pack box w/ dishes -- baby sip cups, tupperware, baby placemat decorated w/ farm animals, coffee grinder.</p>

<p>7:15: walk to cafe for wife's coffee expecting to see friend who looks like Patrick Somerville. Closed. Network failure. Send. Network success.</p>

<p>7:30: success is uplifting in matters of moving, a neverending struggle against hell, coat hangers and boxes. In matters of mobile writing, too.</p>

<p>7:38: fold socks. Note ever-increasing number of missing pairs.</p>

<p>8:03: spill contents of toolbox on moving men. Clean up. Count boxes.</p>

<p>8:06: 114.</p>

<p>8:37: excuse oneself: 120.</p>

<p>8:41: apologize again for toolbox mishap, offer water, coffee. Too early for beer?</p>

<p>8:48: life is 120 boxes. Think Forrest Gump. Think Little SC boy with little prospects. Think You.</p>

<p>8:58: eat: last piece of bread in apartment.</p>

<p>9:51: load to Goodwill. Yoga mat. Bags, bags, bags of clothes.</p>

<p>9:58: think of Tom McCarthy's "Remainder": consider reenacting yr last trip here. Try to remember it first. Network failure.</p>

<p>10:03: pass hospital where your child was born. There is beauty in the inability to explain finality to a child. The beauty of process, flux.</p>

<p>10:06: think: you are at crash risk, texting while driving. No, writing while driving.</p>

<p>10:24: MS13: lucky streetwise gang. Maybe unlucky. Return to cleaning, packing.</p>

<p>10:29: DO YOU HAVE NERVES OF STEEL? New reading series, according to M. Ballentine. Pack toilet tissue.</p>

<p>11:04: precariously balanced boxspring and mattress fall over onto wife fiddling with iPhone. Say, "Can we reenact that?"</p>

<p>11:09: wife scowls, supporting the weight of mattress with one hand, phone in the other. Say, "Sorry."</p>

<p>11:23: after some cajoling, reenact falling bed, you in role of wife. Concentrate. Wonderfully harrowing.</p>

<p>11:24: lead mover says, "Can we take that now?"</p>

<p>11:39: dance. Off the Wall. RIP strangest most catchy man in US history.</p>

<p>1:42 p.m.: near out of juice, be reminded by radio it's a good day to leave Birmingham. County employees slashed by 2/3, which sounds gruesome.</p>

<p>2:00: have celebratory drink - wine in paper coffee cup, High Life can - with wife. Load done. Clean done. Bask in boxless echoes.</p>

<p>2:05: watch squirrels pulling plums from tree in courtyard.</p>

<p>2:13: wonder whose and what story you happen to be telling. Finding the I in the midst of formal itinerarying is impossible.</p>

<p>2:16: movers' forgotten items: spool of inventory sticky numbers, roll of brown packing tape, schizophrenic cat, who loved one half the team.</p>

<p>2:17: hissed at and clawed and clearly wanted to destroy the other half.</p>

<p>2:45: choose PBR on trip to Bottletree, home of good food, few readings, much rock. Last stop en route out, really, though cats need picking up.</p>

<p>2:50: ponder what it says about a place when the patio/smOKay corral is dubbed, sinister as all hell, the HOUSE OF REPTILES.</p>

<p>3:38: get in brief argument with wife. About load weight and, of course, money. To appease, obtain free refill by wits at cafe to coffee up for drive.</p>

<p>3:40: shit. Cross out "wits." Coffee is cold. Proceed drinking, in any case.</p>

<p>4:06: guzzle half-gallon OJ. Jump in car. Destination: Nashville. Bye everyone. For now.</p>

<p>4:07: drive.</p>
