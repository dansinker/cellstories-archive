<h2>The Beautiful Ones</h2>
	<h3>Kathie Bergquist</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p> Early September in 1984. I was 15, hunched over a textbook, trying to conjugate French verbs, when Julie Benning caught my attention, standing in the doorway of my Sophmore French classroom, stabbing the air in my direction and mouthing the words “You’re Dead!”  </p>

<p>      That Julie Benning and I had become friends that summer was the residual effect of all of Julie’s “real” friends being away on family vacations. Prior to that, I doubt that Julie Benning would have been able to identify me by name; <i>despite the fact</i> that we’d gone to the same schools and been in the same classrooms <i>since we were five years old</i>.  </p>

<p>      Of course, I knew who she was:  leading her friends through the hallways of Benjamin Franklin High School – like the headship of an armada, parting the sea of less-significant students. Julie’s moussed, teased, and Aqua-Netted hair framed her face like a glorious straw lion’s mane. Mauve blusher slashed her cheeks; and her pin-prick, ice-colored eyes, were fringed with indigo-blue mascara. Julie Benning was one of the beautiful people.  </p>

<p>      And me, well, figure it out. </p>

<p>      In 1984, Michael Jackson’s <i>Thriller</i> topped the charts. So did Springsteen’s <i>Born in the U.S.A</i>.  1984 brought us “Private Dancer,” “Hello,” and “Jump.” It brought us <i>Footloose</i>.  But all that music slid into irrelevance on June 25… That was the day that a diminuitive man in purple from Chanhassan, Minnesota, released the album that, in 2008, <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> named the number-one best album of the past 25 years.  
<br> 
<br>      And there we were, Julie Benning and me, the last-two-teenaged-girls-in- Minneapolis, sitting on Julie Benning’s bed and listening to the album <i>Purple Rain</i>, over and over again.  </p>

<p>      “Prince is, like, so much sexier than Michael Jackson, ohmygod” Julie said, studying the picture on the album cover: Prince astride a giant purple motorcycle, smirking at the camera, poufs of smoke behind him and, further back, the silhouette of Appolonia in a doorway. “Don’t you think so?”  </p>

<p>      Comparing Prince to Michael Jackson was inevitable, but it was like comparing kittens to cigarettes. Kittens: totally adorable, fluffy, playful. Cigarettes: You would be grounded for life if your mom ever found one in your bedroom.  Michael Jackson was wholesome and boyishly cute. Prince was dangerous. He made you think about things that maybe you hadn’t thought of before.  </p>

<p>      “Ohmygod,” Julie said, “listen to this part.” It was the beginning of the song “Computer Blue,” where Lisa says to Wendy, “Wendy, is the water warm enough?” And Wendy says “Yes, Lisa.” And then Lisa says, “Shall we begin?” And Wendy says, “Yes, Lisa.”  </p>

<p>      “They’re, like, ohmygod, totally going to take a bath together,” Julie said. “They’re lesbians.” Scandalized titilation glinted in her eyes, and the side of her mouth hooked up. She locked eyes with me across the bed, waiting for my reaction.  </p>

<p>      “Wow,” I said. My palms dampened.  </p>

<p>      Suddenly, Julie set the album down on her bedspread and jumped up. “I’m, like, totally bored,” she said. “Wanna go to 7-11?”  </p>

<p>      All through our suicide slurpees, my head buzzed. <i>Were</i> Wendy and Lisa lesbians? Did they have sex <i>with each other</i>? The idea was both shocking and,  strangely… exciting. </p>

<p>      When the movie Purple Rain opened in late July, we were the first in line and sat through it <i>three times</i>, the tears streaming down our faces every time it reached the climax with Prince performing the title song, and all the pain that he had been through, and Lake Minnetonka, and Morris Day and The Time… In the context of the movie, the songs on the album took on heightened meaning, from the grinding sexuality of “Darling Nikki”, to animalistic cry of the heart that was “The Beautiful Ones,” to the triumph and redemption of  “Baby, I’m a Star.”   </p>

<p>      Meanwhile, I kept my eyes glued to Wendy and Lisa, looking for evidence. </p>

<p>      One day, while Julie sat at her vanity table, rubbing Clearasil over an outbreak of acne across her jawline, she announced, “I’m totally like Appalonia. Like, I’m totally going to end up married to, like, ohmygod, a tortured artist or something.”  </p>

<p>      “<i>Totally</i>,” I said.  </p>

<p>      In truth, I didn’t really like Appalonia. She was so quick to go over to Morris Day when Prince really needed her. For my part, Prince and I shared the same soul. I mean, obviously, my dad was in heating and cooling and not a failed jazz musician, and I wasn’t living in his basement. It was more a matter of sensibility. Other people got that he was in pain, but I <i>felt</i> his pain inside me as if it were my own.  Julie wanted to <i>marry</i> Prince. I wanted to <i>be</i> Prince.  
<br> 
<br>      Living in Minneapolis, Julie and I had an advantage over Prince fans everywhere else, because the movie was set in Minneapolis – Prince actually lived there. We started staking out First Avenue, the nightclub where he was supposed to be a regular. We passed <i>whole afternoons there</i>, watching people come and go.  </p>

<p>      Then, Kyle Shipman came in to the picture.  </p>

<p>      Kyle appeared one day, on the corner opposite us. He was hard to miss in his long, purple jacket and lace neck scarf, black eyeliner sweating down his face in August’s humidity.  We sized each other up but kept our distance. The next day he crossed the street in our direction, hand stretched out before reaching us, offering Julie a purple feather. “It’s a dove’s feather,” he said, and from that moment on, we. couldn’t. shake. him.  </p>

<p>      Kyle’s family had just moved to Minneapolis. He’d be attending Franklin High School as a junior. He had a car, a beat-up white Camaro with gray primer on the hood. The three of us sat at Embers late at night, drinking coffee after coffee after coffee, while Kyle tried to act like he <i>was</i> Prince; he even tried to imitate Prince’s voice.  He said stuff like, “Sexuality… <i>isabeautifulthing</i>. It’s human nature.”  </p>

<p>      It was obvious he had a thing for Julie, but I couldn’t believe she’d fall for that crap. She ate it up. Once, she had the nerve to say to me: “Kyle is, like, ohmygod, the white Prince.” </p>

<p>      <i>Are you</i> kidding <i>me</i>? I thought. Prince was <i>way</i> more than just a frilly scarf and black eye-liner. Kyle’s transparency was obvious. Couldn’t she see what was right in front of her face? <i>I</i> was the one with the reckless spirit and the ache inside of me that wouldn’t go away. </p>

<p>      But that wasn’t even the worst of my problems. Because about that time, Julie’s other friends started to return home from their family vacations… and Julie spent less and less time with <i>either</i> of us. Even though he got on my nerves, Kyle and I continued to hang out, doing the same things. But without Julie, the hours we passed on the corner, across the street from First Avenue, felt hollow.   </p>

<p>      That’s when Kyle came up with an idea so brilliant, I’d wished I thought of it first. In fact, I wished Kyle wasn’t involved at all.  </p>

<p>      We called Julie from the Embers payphone.  </p>

<p>      “It’s almost… <i>theendofsummer</i>,” Kyle said. “Before school starts, we all need to go baptise ourselves… <i>inthewatersofLakeMinnetonka</i>. I can get some beer,” he added, “<i>frommybrother</i>.”  </p>

<p>      I don’t know if it was the promise of adventure, the solemnity of ritual, a need for closure, the beer, or that, just maybe, she missed us but, miraculously, Julie agreed.  </p>

<p>      The last Friday of summer vacation: It was dusk. Kyle pulled the Camaro up to the shore of the lake – “Let’s Go Crazy” blasted from the speakers. We sat in the grass, near a public boat slip, drinking beer and just hanging out and it felt like it used to, when Julie and I would sit on her bed, except for the beer and being outside and Kyle being there, and a few other details. Across the lake, the silhouettes of sailboats made witch’s teeth on the orange horizon, and the air had that quality it has when it’s still warm out but you can smell autumn in the wings.  </p>

<p>      Okay, we’re here, I thought. Now what?  </p>

<p>      Now what? Now what is what we all swore, <i>swore</i>, that we would keep a secret. That it was no big deal, and so stupid that it didn’t matter anyway. We all promised each other that we wouldn’t tell, even if it was idiotic, just… <i>because</i>. The only problem is, someone did tell. </p>

<p>      I knew it on the first day of school, arriving at my locker after class. I knew in gym class, from the hissing words sliding out of the edges of people’s mouths.  When I entered the cafeteria at lunchtime Julie was there, but her friends closed in around her, like a fortress.  </p>

<p>      In biology, Michelle Littman slathered, “Kyle Shipman told Paul Sam that you and Julie Benning made out at Lake Minnetonka, but Julie Benning said that you totally attacked her and went all lesbo on her. Is that true?”  </p>

<p>      My blood went cold. I felt like Prince did, the night that he saw Appolonia out at First Avenue with Morris Day.  Blatantly, flagrantly betrayed. To deny what happened would be one thing. But to make it out like I <i>attacked</i> her? That didn’t even make sense.  </p>

<p>      Here’s what really happened:  </p>

<p>      We were sitting in a circle on the grass, on the shore of Lake Minnetonka, blasting Prince. Julie looked pretty. Her bangs were higher than ever. And if you could have grabbed onto the night sky you would have pulled it against your face – it felt as soft as an angora sweater and smelled like possibility.  </p>

<p>      <i>Wendy? Yes Lisa? Is the water warm enough? Yes Lisa.</i>
<br>  
<br>      “Lesbians… are cool,” Kyle said. “Two women together... <i>Itsabeautifulthing</i>.”  </p>

<p>      I hoped it was too dark to see me blush. Kyle continued, “I mean, have you two ever…” He nodded between Julie and me, “You know…”  </p>

<p>      We both blurt out: “No!”  </p>

<p>      “Wow,” Kyle said. “Why are you… <i>so uptight</i>?”  </p>

<p>      Julie argued, “I’m, like, totally not uptight.”  </p>

<p>      Kyle laughed. “Oh yeah?... Prove it.”  </p>

<p>      I sat frozen but Julie suddenly, quickly, leaned over and pecked at my face.  </p>

<p>      “There,” she said. </p>

<p>       Giggling stupidly, I wiped my cheek. </p>

<p>      “No,” Kyle said, “Do it like you mean it.”  </p>

<p>      “Ohmygod,” Julie said, “All right.”  </p>

<p>      I should have said “Wait a second.” I should have scrambled to my feet. But instead as Julie leaned toward me, I tilted into her. Our lips brushed and then lingered and something traveled between us that made both of our eyes pop open with surprise.  </p>

<p>      “Holy crap!” Kyle said, dropping all Prince affectation from his voice, “You really <i>are</i> lesbians…”  
<br> 
<br>       “So, you see,” I said, to Michelle Littman, back in biology class, “they’re both totally blowing it out of proportion. It was really just stupid. It didn’t mean anything.” As the words left my mouth, I knew my version of events would make its way back to Julie, and I knew I was dead meat.  </p>

<p>      And sure enough, there she was, standing in the doorway of my French classroom.  
<br> 
<br>      Yes, I was dead. The realization made me feel sick to my stomach. But even then, I felt there was something bigger and truer blossoming in me, something that made it almost not matter that Julie and her friends would surely be waiting for me after school.  Because at <i>that precise moment</i> that I first saw Julie standing in the doorway, before her words or her hatred even processed in my brain, something happened. My heart alighted. My heart alighted when I saw her and that brought me back to the lake and the kiss and that spark that traveled between us that I <i>knew</i> we both felt. It was an understanding that – suddenly - changed <i>everything</i>, and it was an understanding that we shared.  </p>

<p>      My class sat in silent expectation, eyes ping-ponging between Julie and me, waiting to see what would happen next. Well, there’s the real version of events (me sinking into my chair, turning my eyes quickly away from the doorway), but then there’s the other version: what happened in my imagination. Because in my imagination, I asked myself, if Prince were in this situation, what would he do? I stood up. I stood up, stepped towards Julie, and I said:  </p>

<p>      <i>I never meant 2 cause u any sorrow. I never meant 2 cause u any pain. I only wanted 2 one time see u laughing. I only wanted 2 see u laughing in the purple rain…</i></p>
