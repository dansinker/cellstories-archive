<h2>Fairies</h2>
	<h3>Julie Ganey</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>  I was ten years old when my mother revealed to me that there wasn’t a Santa Claus.  </p>

<p>      We were lying on my parents’ bed, and I remember running my finger along the wavy pattern stitched into the green velveteen bedspread, over and over. Now, I’d asked my Mom about Santa, badgered her, actually, but when she finally admitted it, it was a blow. Rather than feeling vindicated that my suspicions were correct, I felt a little betrayed, a little lied to. I remember her saying that “the spirit of Christmas is real, and that’s what’s important,” but I just wondered why the whole world was in on a conspiracy to get kids to believe in a big fat man in a red suit that didn’t exist.  </p>

<p>      That’s not what I was thinking about last June, though, as I sat on my neighbor, Gina’s front porch, drinking really cold Pinot Grigio. I was thinking about my garden, as I sat with my friends, Gina and Dale, watching our kids playing in the front yard, eight of them between the three of us (but only one’s mine, so it’s all lopsided). Our husbands straggled out from time to time, joining us and leaving us as they pleased. The only remarkable thing about the almost identical wood frame houses on our street in Rogers Park are the nice big front porches and the open front yards which connect all the way down the block, not broken up by fences or trees, where the kids chase each other and claim ownership of the entire block, as much as kids can these days, when they have to be constantly watched. </p>

<p>      On this particular night, the older kids, the tweens and teenagers, were next door on my own front porch, whispering and then laughing too loudly, posing a little for each other even though they’ve known each other since they were babies. The littler kids, my own four-year-old and Gina’s daughter, Serafina, were playing with sidewalk chalk, in their own signature style, which involved garden hoses, buckets of water, and lots of chalk that was then mixed into a paste to be applied, thick and VanGogh-like, to the sidewalk. The front yard was littered with the activities they’d already exhausted: bikes, a scooter, plastic dishes full of mud and leaves, a couple of soccer balls. </p>

<p>      Gina glanced at over at her son on my porch and whispered, “I think Vincent must have heard Mauro and me having sex, because he sleeps with his door shut every night now.”  </p>

<p>      Dale said, “There are all sorts of reasons an eleven year old boy sleeps with his door shut, and they all have to do with sex.” </p>

<p>      We laugh and drink, and I notice my hands on the wine glass, wrecked from an afternoon in the garden, hacking away at plants that threaten to take over the entire yard. When we first moved into our house, I embraced gardening with more passion than skill, throwing everything I could lay my hands on into the ground. Now, five years later, the flowers beds require constant pruning and dividing. I’ve even just dug stuff up and given it away on my front sidewalk with a cheery little “free perennials!” sign. It’s a part time job from May to October to keep the vegetation at bay. </p>

<p>      “Mom. We need something to do.” It’s my daughter, Dorothy. She approaches the porch, and kicks her filthy little foot against mine. </p>

<p>      “Why don’t you write a note to Art and Erin on their sidewalk?” I suggest. </p>

<p>      “We’re tired of chalk,” she whines. </p>

<p>      Serafina, Gina’s youngest and Dorothy’s best friend, joins her at the foot of the porch steps, her little brown belly smeared with pink chalk. “We want something to eat, we’re hungry,” she angles. </p>

<p>      “No,” Gina says, “No more snacks.” </p>

<p>      “Why don’t you take your dollies for a walk?” I suggest. </p>

<p>      “No, they’re sleeping,” Dorothy says, irritated by our obtuseness. I look at her sweaty face and glassy eyes. It’s obvious she’s exhausted. The responsible thing to do would be to take her in, put her in a bath and then into bed. But I don’t want to, I want to stay here chatting, admiring our children while they amuse themselves. </p>

<p>      “Listen,” I say, “Summer solstice is in a few days, when the fairies dance all night. Why don’t you write them a note and invite them into our yards?” </p>

<p>      Dorothy and Serafina look to each other, eyes wide. “Yeah!” they say, and scramble up the stairs and into the house for paper and pens, which they bring out and fling in front of Tony and Caity, the two eight year olds. “We need you to help us write notes to the fairies,” they announce, and splay themselves in the yard. Gina gives me an impressed nod.  This was perfect - an imaginative activity that invited an appreciation of nature and the invisible world, was girly enough to sustain their interest, and had nothing to do with the insidious Disney Princess culture. </p>

<p>      An hour later, we’re picking up the yards, heading inside for the night, but not before I tack two notes to the fairies on the big tree that stands between the sidewalk and the street in front of our house. Dorothy’s note is full of pleas for friendship, and Serafina’s is full of questions: “Where do you live? How big are you? What do you eat?” They’ve collected some pretty rocks and clover as offerings to leave at the base of the tree. </p>

<p>      Late that night, before I go to bed, I scrounge up some art paper – it looks woodlandy, with twigs and flower petals pressed into it, and, disguising my handwriting by using my left hand, I compose a note from the fairies: </p>

<p>“Dear Children, We eat flower nectar and berries from your gardens while you’re sleeping. We spend our time dancing, making flowers grow, and enjoying all things that are beautiful. We love living in your yards, because you are children who are very kind to each other.” </p>

<p>      I tack the note to the big tree, taking the girls’ letters, and go to bed. The next morning, there is squealing and wonder as the girls rush to the tree in their nightgowns and present the note to me to read for them. That evening, the same front porch ritual unfolds, and this time the fairies leave the girls a little garden of translucent lollipops in the front flowerbed, bedecked with ribbons and their names. That’s when fairy fever really kicked in. Tony and Caity, the eight-year-olds, began writing notes at dusk as well. They were too old to truly believe in fairies, but they weren’t stupid – it always makes more sense to participate in an enterprise that is supplying you with candy, and ask the hard questions later. The kids demanded endless information from the fairies:  </p>

<p>“Dear Fairies, Do you know the tooth fairy? Do you know Mary and Fred, the bullfrogs that disappeared from the Fishers’ pond? Thank you for the candy, but could you please leave a magic wand? A real one? Can you turn little girls into fairies? Please take us to Fairyland with you. We are very good dancers.”   </p>

<p>      I had to get a little more inventive with my late night fairy notes: </p>

<p>      “Dear children, yes we know the tooth fairy, but she is very busy and travels a lot. We like pretty rocks and flowers, but don’t like squirrels. We’re afraid it’s too risky to leave you a magic wand, because the elves might come along and steal it. Yes, we know Mary and Fred, they are dear frog friends, and lots of fun.” </p>

<p>       This last bit was tricky, because all the adults would bet money that Noel, the Fisher’s own bloodthirsty cat had massacred the frogs, but like the fact that your parents have sex, this was information those kids didn’t really want.  </p>

<p>      I spent my late evenings devising methods for the fairies to delight the girls - leaving tiny piles of fairy dust, or a trail of pebbles leading to a basket of strawberries. At one point, my neighbor Gina, watching her kids discover their names spelled out in sticks in the back yard, offered vaguely, “Do you need any help with this?” But it was so gratifying – look, no one can excel in every area of motherhood, but this, this I could do! </p>

<p>      Late one night, I found Dorothy, her forehead pressed against the screen in her window, searching the yard below. “I can hear them, but I can’t see them,” she said. </p>

<p>      “Really?” I asked. “What do they sound like?” </p>

<p>      “Oh, bells and whispering and stuff. Don’t get near the window,” she waved at me, “They won’t come out if grownups are around. They just like kids.” </p>

<p>      One night around midnight, my husband, Brad, padded out onto the front porch, to find me teetering atop a stepstool in the wet grass, tying pink ribbons to the branches of an overgrown hydrangea. </p>

<p>      “What are you doing?” he asked sleepily. </p>

<p>      “Well, I’m decorating this tree.” </p>

<p>      “No, really. What are you doing?” He sat down on the top step of the porch. “This fairy stuff seems a little out of hand. I mean, they really believe.” </p>

<p>      “Well, it’s great that they believe,” I said, “It’s giving them an experience of magic.” </p>

<p>      “Yeah, but it’s untrue, Julie,” he says carefully. “It’s a lie.” </p>

<p>      “It’s not a lie. Fairies don’t exist, but magic does, and that’s what’s important.” </p>

<p>      He rested his head on the banister, looked at me, his dark eyes weighted with sleep. “I’m just saying that you’re creating a situation where it’s completely irrational for them not to believe in fairies, because everything around them supports the idea, as much as everything supports the concept of gravity.” </p>

<p>      “Honey, don’t over-think it.” I took my ribbon scissors and began hacking away at the wild oregano under the tree. “Jesus, this stuff grows so fast you can see it. It’s taking over the yard.”</p>

<p>      And then, as I heard Brad sigh and head inside, that’s when I thought of my mother and me on the green bedspread talking about Santa. How the depth and scope of that discovery had called everything into question. What about the special Santa wrapping paper, the muddy footprint by the fireplace, the reindeer tracks we had seen on the sloping roof of the house?  And what was this going to be like for Dorothy? To discover the truth about fairies was to unravel something of magic in general, to untie a knot that won’t hold anything together anymore. If fairies are a hoax, then there goes the Tooth Fairy. And if she’s made up, why not the Easter Bunny, Santa, God, for that matter? Santa and God have a lot in common, with their white beards and the keeping track of whether you’re good or not, but God, poor God. When was the last time He showed up at the mall? I sat there on the stepstool, the oregano bleeding perfume at my feet, realizing that there’s no way to unplant a seed, unless you want to leave a gaping hole. </p>

<p>      The next day, after the ribbon tree had been celebrated and danced around, it became clear that another corner had been turned. I arrived home from a rehearsal in the middle of the day, to find Dorothy and Serafina in their swimsuits on the front sidewalk, screaming at the sky.  </p>

<p>      “Fairies, we see you! Come down here!”  </p>

<p>      As I got out of the car, Dorothy yelled, “Mom, look! The fairies are writing in the sky!” I looked up to see a trail of white airplane exhaust in the clear blue sky. Serafina and Dorothy continued their hoarse screaming, their little bodies rigid with passion, the sprinkler running and forgotten in the yard.  I joined Brad, who was sitting on the porch swing watching them.  </p>

<p>      “Did you tell them the plane exhaust was fairy writing?’ I asked.  </p>

<p>      He shook his head. </p>

<p>      “What’s it say, Mom? What does it say?” Dorothy demanded. </p>

<p>      “I don’t know,” I shrugged, helplessly. </p>

<p>      Over the next few days, Dorothy and Serafina became obsessed with visiting fairyland. Somehow they got the idea that they could go at night, in their sleep, and that if they drank enough of what they called “special potion,” limes squeezed into water, they would start shrinking. They demanded to be measured several times a day, proclaiming, “I feel like I’m getting shorter, Mom, I really do!” Then, Serafina announced that she had actually gone to fairyland during the night. After that they would no longer eat cantaloupe, because in fairyland, it tasted like poop. </p>

<p>      The summer wore on, the blackberry bushes took over the lavender in the garden, and the notes to the fairies continued, their tone changing a bit, becoming less plaintive and a little more demanding: “Why can’t we see you? Why are you hiding? Will you leave us money?” I started not answering their notes sometimes, but that didn’t slow the girls down. As Dorothy’s 5th birthday approached, at the end of August, she became obsessed with the fairies attending her party. Hyped up on magic, she wanted a magician to come and do a show in our backyard. The day of her birthday was beautiful, the cake covered in flowers, the magician a good sport, taking the time to show some of his tricks to Dorothy afterwards.</p>

<p>      That night, entering her room to tuck her in, I found her, once again, forehead against the screen, searching the yard below. </p>

<p>      “Hey,” I said, sitting on the edge of the bed. </p>

<p>      She pulled away from the window and looked at me. </p>

<p>      “Did you have a nice party, honey?” </p>

<p>      “Mm-hm.” She reached out her finger and ran it across the screen. </p>

<p>      “Did you like the magician?” </p>

<p>      “Well, I wanted a real magician. One who could do the real magic, not just tricks. And the fairies didn’t come. They never come. They never let us see them.”  </p>

<p>      Her face was filled with desperation, a longing that took me forward in time to when she would be a teenager and would want a boy she couldn’t have, or when she’d be older than that, wanting all manner of things that people and fairies could not deliver.  </p>

<p>      “Do you think they’re really out there, Mom?” she asked. </p>

<p>      “What do you think?” I countered. </p>

<p>      “I don’t know.”  </p>

<p>      A few days later the fairies would leave a final note, wishing the kids on the block a good school year, bidding them goodbye, as they ran from the cool weather in a clumsy, unsatisfying exit. </p>

<p>      But that night, Dorothy’s birthday, we lay down together, my face buried in her hair that smelled vaguely of cake. We lay there, neither of us sure, listening to what we could almost hear through the window: the plants groaning over their borders in the garden, and the fairies packing their bags.</p>
