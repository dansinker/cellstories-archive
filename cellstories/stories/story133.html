<h2>Brothers</h2>

		</p><p>When I was twenty-one years old I suffered my first real heartbreak. My girlfriend, Kate, left me for an older, more successful guy and I was absolutely crushed. It was one of those kind of breakups, know what I mean? I was ruined, heartbroken, life meant nothing and so I holed up in my stinky little studio and watched endless hours of TV and ate endless amounts of junk food and talked nonsense to my cat, a stray tabby I'd nicknamed Frodo Baggins, whose unquestioning gaze and twitching tale seemed the only thing in the world capable of understanding my pain. </p>

<p>Then late one night in December, close to the holidays, as I sat around marinating in my own self-pity, there was a pounding at my front door and a frantic ringing of the doorbell. I'd fallen asleep watching an episode of Cops with a bag of Doritos for comfort food. I roused myself from the sofa and opened the door and standing there, skulking in the darkness, backlit with shadowy streetlights, was my older brother, Mitch, a big wide cockeyed grin spread across his face. He was thinner,  more gaunt, more hunched about the shoulders since I'd last seen him. He looked spent, wasted by his own energy or anger or whatever it was that drove him. </p>

<p>“Hey, little brother!” he said, waltzing right past me into my apartment. “You look like crap. What's up?” He talked as if I'd see him just the day before instead of what? A year? Two? </p>

<p>“It's a little late for a visit, don't you think?” I said. But he ignored me and flopped himself down onto the sofa, nearly sitting on my cat, which dashed down the hallway. </p>

<p>“Got any weed?” he asked hopefully. </p>

<p>“No.” I said. </p>

<p>Now, if you have an older brother, you know what it means to be oppressed. </p>

<p>Mitch was five years older than me and when we were growing up he became an expert at devising specific tortures for his one and only little brother, which was me. He was like my own personal Torquemada, and in his eyes I was a heretic. Such is the lot of the younger, weaker sibling. </p>

<p>Mitch loved the Milk Torture. This is where he took a big gulp of milk and swished it around in his mouth for few seconds, which made his saliva real viscous and thick and gooey. After swallowing the milk he would hunt me down, pin my shoulders to the floor with his knees and proceed to let a long thin stream of  milky-white saliva drip slowly out of his mouth until it hung an inch above my nose. And just at the point of no return, when I thought my face would be covered in a massive gob of milk spit, he would suck it all back into his mouth, like a film strip in reverse.  </p>

<p>I know. Gross. </p>

<p>One time Mitch tricked me into eating a sandwich with Limburger cheese on it and if you don't know, Limburger is just about the most disgusting smelliest stinkiest cheese ever made. It smells like I don't what, like something dead pulled out of a river. He made a big show about how delicious it was and what did I know? Older brothers know everything, right? So I took a big bite and then I had the taste of something dead pulled out of a river in my mouth. For a week. </p>

<p>I was the recipient of random frog punches, a particularly painful kind of knuckle punch that Mitch would land expertly on the bone of my upper arm. My arms were littered with dull yellow bruises. </p>

<p>At night, in the room we shared, he would spin the most terrifying yarns where the victim of some machete wielding maniac was always a defenseless younger brother about the age of nine. </p>

<p>Also, Mitch had convinced me that he had the authority to put me up for adoption whenever he wanted.  He referred to some obscure law that granted firstborn sons this special priviledge and he could act on it “when deemed necessary.” He made vague references to “the agency” and if ever I pissed him off, wouldn't do his chores or was found to be annoying, he would look me dead in the eye, put a cupped hand to his ear as if to make a phone call and in a devilish whisper say, “Hmmmmm. It's about time I checked in with the agency.” I lived in fear of a group of white-jacketed henchmen barging into my room in the middle of the night to whisk me away to live with another family on the other side of the earth, never to be heard from again.  </p>

<p>My allowance money vanished on a regular basis. </p>

<p>At the age of ten, I tasted beer for the first time, courtesy of Mitch (Pabst Blue Ribbon). </p>

<p>At eleven, I tried chewing tobacco with him, too. </p>

<p>I was twelve when I did my first bong hit, listening to Lynard Skynard just before going to my Aunt Eunice's funeral. The funeral was the funniest thing I had ever seen. My mother made me kneel in front of the casket to say a prayer and I burst into hysterical laughter. Afterwords, I was told that I was grounded for the rest of my life. </p>

<p>Somehow, for some strange reason, I always forgave Mitch. It's a mystery how he could get away with so much.  But I guess I was spellbound by his wild charm, his switchblade eyes and his will.  </p>

<p>When he was eighteen, he took off. Ran away. Disappeared. Didn't bother to finish high school. And weeks later I started to receive postcards from him and he was in Montana working on a farm, in Alaska on a fishing boat, in Florida living on a beach. And while my father lost himself in work, my mother sat on the porch and smoked cigarettes, searching the horizon as if any minute Mitch would appear, ambling home with his cockeyed grin. </p>

<p>And eventually he did return and lived with friends and lost himself in drink, in drugs and fights. The good times, he called it. He'd take me to lunch occasionally, after school, take me over to Little Louie's hot dog stand and we'd sit on benches in the park across the street and he would look at me and say, “sometimes, you just gotta go your own way, kid.”  But it seemed like something resigned was seeping into his bones and later he'd disappear again. One time he came home for Thanksgiving and he showed up drunk and high and he and my father fought, terribly, tumbling through the house and out the door onto the front lawn for all the neighbors to see. </p>

<p>And then, at twenty-one, he decided to go straight, talked about going to college, studying botany or something, but one night he was out drinking and broke into a store to steal some beer and got caught by the police who he beat up pretty badly, and in drunken remorse used one of the policeman's walkie talkie's to call for backup. He spent a year or so in prison, down in Statesville. He'd call sometimes. The stories I heard... </p>

<p>But he was out in time to see me graduate from high school and he helped me move into my apartment when I started college. And then he was gone again. I imagined him off on some wild adventure: in the bush in Africa or all of a sudden he's a lobsterman on the coast of Maine or tramping through South America with some wild-eyed girl in tow. Reinventing himself everywhere, as if one life wasn't enough or there wasn't enough world for him. </p>

<p>That night in December when he came back to see me, returning from nowhere, it was just like always. His eyes settled on me, looked me up and down, from head to toe, like one of those MRI machines and  he just knew me, knew my life, knew my secrets, knew my pain. </p>

<p>“So. What's goin' on?” </p>

<p>And I trembled and confessed, like some repentent sinner and told him all about my lost love and painted a picture of my heartbreak where, of course, I was the victim of romantic injustice and he sat there taking it all in.  Looking back on it, I know what I told him must have been the biggest sad-sack self pitying story ever, but he listened intently, frowning, like a doctor hearing the ailments of a patient, and when I was done he was on his feet, giving me one of his I-got-it-all-figured-out-looks, snapping his fingers like a drumbeat, saying, “I know exactly what you need, kid!” and his eyes roamed the corners and tables of my little apartment and he rifled through the mess on my desk and pulled out two pieces of notebook paper. I lay curled up on the couch, fetal, and watched his madness. </p>

<p>“What you need, kid,”  he said with a flourish, “is a paper airplane!” </p>

<p>“Oh, for God's sake!” I cried. But he would have none of it. He yanked me to my feet and made me watch as he nimbly folded and creased and constructed two fine paper airplanes.  </p>

<p>You know, the kind of airplanes you make in gradeschool and sail across the room when the teacher is writing something on the chalkboard. That kind. Where he came up with the notion that this was the remedy for my all important heartbreak I have no idea, but before I could gather any thoughts we were in his car needling our way through traffic and then we were standing atop Cricket Hill over by Montrose Harbor, our paper airplanes in hand, and it was a cold clear winter night, no one was around, and real airplanes moved in a stately procession off the lake heading towards O'Hare, and Mitch was talking a mile a minute about some girl he'd gotten into a bar fight over when he was in South Dakota or something, but I half-listened as I surveyed the lake, the empty soccer fields, the sky and I did start to feel a little better, maybe because I hadn't been out of my apartment in weeks or had any real contact with anyone since the break up with Kate, but then Mitch nudged me and said to me, he said,</p>

<p>“Hey, you know what the sound of the universe is?” </p>

<p>I shook my head. Told him no. </p>

<p>“Sure?” he asked. “Well, it's this....” </p>

<p>And he went into a half-crouch and scooped a lungful of air into his chest and went:</p>

<p>“AHHOOOOooommm....” </p>

<p>“Wow.” I said. “Cool.” </p>

<p>“C'mon. Try it with me.” So I indulged him and we stood atop Cricket hill, our paper airplanes in hand, and together made the sound of the universe. It was silly. But I did it anyway.</p>

<p>“AAHHHHOOOOOmmmm....” </p>

<p>Funny, though. Strange. I felt all emptied out. Calm. </p>

<p>“Not bad, huh?” he said. </p>

<p>“No. You're right,” I said. “Not bad at all.” I felt awash in warm water. Good. Clean. Clear. Better than I'd felt in weeks. And I looked south and saw Lake Shore Drive curled like an electric artery and all the apartment buildings and condos crowned with lights and the John Hancock Tower standing like a proud sentinel and I looked north and thought of all the people living in the nooks and crannies of Edgewater and Rogers Park, Evanston and the mansions of the wealthy along the North Shore, and all the lives portioned out further west, and to the east the darkness of Lake Michigan, and it was like the city itelf was breathing, alive, pulsing, a living thing, with heat, moving in some mad struggle to survive and its heartbeat was right under my feet.  </p>

<p>Mitch put his arm around me and nodded toward the long row of apartments lining Lake Shore Drive. </p>

<p>“Do you realize how many people, right now, in those apartments right there in front of us, right....now, are screwing their brains out? I mean like right-”  here he paused for dramatic effect and swept his arm out in a grand gesture that included the whole city- “now are screwing like little bunnies. You can't imagine what pleasure people are giving to each other right now all over the world, kid. There's probably like 50 million people screwing as we speak, having a great time. That's what its all about.”  </p>

<p>I have to admit I hadn't ever really heard about this particular philosophy or way of looking at the world, but consider the state I was in. I mean I was pretty vulnerable. So at the time, and maybe even now, he did have a good point. Call it the Tao of Mitch.</p>

<p> He pointed a finger at my chest. “You should be one of them, little brother. Get out of this shit your in. Find yourself another girl.” </p>

<p>“Okay,” I said. </p>

<p>“Now let's give these paper airplanes a whirl.” And we stretched our arms out behind us and counted to three and set the planes aloft and watched them sail away. Mitch gave me a shove and screamed and took off in a mad dash down the hill and I watched him, this strange man, my kin, this stranger, my brother who shares my blood and I knew the next day he would be gone and I wouldn't see him for who knows how long and that hurt and I was angry at him, but thankful for the little bit of grace, the gift he'd given me. You couldn't really get close to him. You just had to take what you could get and accept all the rest. </p>

<p>That night we went out and got drunk. I woke the next morning and found a note taped to the front door that said, “See ya' around, kid!” And I saw that he'd helped himself to the rest of the cash in my wallet. </p>

<p>And that was it. I haven't seen him in a long time now, maybe I never will again. For some reason I don't think so. But I picture him, sometimes, standing on the side of a road, a thumb out, waiting for a ride, unrepentent, wearing a crown of imperfections, the night wrapped all around him, following his heart, as he knows he should.</p>
