<h2>My Revolutionary</h2>
	<h3>Jennifer Krasinski</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>I was once in love with a revolutionary who, for the life of him, could not tell a joke.</p>

<p>He would omit important details – that the rabbi was wearing a duck, for example, or that the little old lady was still a virgin – declaring these particulars to be pointlessly offensive and espousing that a good joke should charm and not harm its audience.</p>

<p>To prevent him from bombing as he had over and over again in front of our well-mannered friends, family and comrades, I encouraged him to try simpler comedies: sight gags, one-liners, knock-knocks.</p>

<p>“What about a homonym?” I offered, “Or a pun? After all, you have such a good ear.” I made a comb of my fingers and pushed his hair back behind one of them to underscore my point.</p>

<p>He bent his head forward, shook his graying layers free, and sighed. “Just because people don’t laugh at my jokes doesn’t mean I’m going to compromise my beliefs.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” I replied, and proved my assent with a smile.</p>

<p>It was only when my revolutionary removed my hand from his face, told me he’d had enough of us, and asked me – with the utmost diplomacy and no detectable sadness – to please get out, that I understood that in trying to save his jokes, I had sunk our relationship.</p>

<p>“<i>C’est la vie</i>,” shrugged a so-called friend of mine when I told her at lunch that we – my revolutionary and I – were over.</p>

<p>She made note of my silence and tried again.</p>

<p>“He wasn’t good enough for you,” she said, “self-righteous, self-centered, and a complete bore.”</p>

<p>“He was a proud romantic,” I corrected, “and he didn’t suffer fools.”</p>

<p>“All those phantom platforms,” she continued, “Peace? Justice? Equality? Those are eternal problems – not real ones.”</p>

<p>“At least he worked in the service of an ideal,” I challenged.</p>

<p>“That he did,” she said, and it was then that my so-called friend admitted to a drunken bungle with my revolutionary once when I was out of town.</p>

<p>She described their encounter as inevitable but passionless. She explained that he had wooed her with his confession of a nagging ambivalence towards me, and had ended their hours-long tryst with a pup-eyed appeal for her silence regarding their misconduct.</p>

<p>“He had others too, you know” she sighed, “lots.”</p>

<p>“I know,” I lied.</p>

<p>Months later, I picked the Sunday paper up from my doorstep to discover that my revolutionary had made the front page.</p>

<p>CAR BOMB KILLS TWO it read, and although the words that followed described in great detail what happened to him and where, a serrated grief has whittled the story I tell to the following points.</p>

<p>My revolutionary had been traveling with a beautiful, young relief worker, when the car they were driving broke down.</p>

<p>Wanting to finish their journey before nightfall, they hastily borrowed a car from an acquaintance, a contractor.</p>

<p>When I recount the story of my revolutionary for an audience, this is the place I pause to right myself before the punch line.</p>

<p>“’I know it sounds cold,” said the contractor to the reporter,’” I tell them, “’but tragedies like these are all in the timing,’” and then I pinch myself to keep from doing the only thing under the circumstances I feel I can do.</p>
