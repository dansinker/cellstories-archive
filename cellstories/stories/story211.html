<h2>Bleedproof</h2>
	<h3>John H. Matthews</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p> She’s in The Ranchero Strangiato late night, enjoying a cigarette with her coffee.</p>

<p>      She’s wearing a black T-shirt from the seventies that says I JUST SPENT THE NIGHT WITH MUHAMMAD ALI. The date for the Vegas bout is on the back. She’s reading a book called Success in the Business World.</p>

<p>      She sees me staring at the book, wondering.</p>

<p>      “It’s crap,” she says, putting it down.</p>

<p>      “Why are you reading it?”</p>

<p>      “Because my father gave it to me.”</p>

<p>      “Is your father successful?”</p>

<p>      “My father is dead.” </p>

<p>Journal entry: There is something ancient in her eyes—death and strangulation. </p>

<p>      We go see a junkie saxophonist who pays his rent in the room above by hooking his sax on Thursday nights. Off stage, he is a shambling, muttering old man mess. Onstage, he’s the oracle. </p>

<p>      She waits tables and is working on a performance art piece in which a woman undergoes a species change to a deer. </p>

<p>      I almost don’t make it in to work the next day. My lungs are Los Angeles on smog alert. My heart is a 1945 championship football. My nerves have more screwed up connections than a Haitian phone company. </p>

<p>Journal entry: The graffiti in the bathroom was like Jung’s unconscious. </p>

<p>      Next date, a mainstream movie we both figure we’ll hate. It’s four hours long. The reel breaks halfway through. A horse disappears mid-leap. </p>

<p>      “That was enough,” she says while someone unseen scrambles to tape Celluloid. “Let’s go for coffee.” </p>

<p>      We take a cab to The Strangiato. On the way there are ice slicks and dangerous speeds. We almost hit a BMW. At the cafe, I give the driver an extra five bucks for not killing us. </p>

<p>      At the end of the counter a man is telling another: “Fuck relax! I haven’t relaxed since ‘Nam!” </p>

<p>      The cook’s eyes are chemical, fires dancing in a gale, threatening to extinguish at any second. </p>

<p>      Later:</p>

<p>      In bed:</p>

<p>      After sex: </p>

<p>      I tell her she is a beautiful mystery. </p>

<p>      She says: “My life is Good Times without J.J.” </p>

<p>Journal entry: I am as much for World War III as against it. </p>

<p><h4>***</h4></p><p>We are traveling near San Francisco. She has a box of fortune cookies open on her lap, cracking them open and reading the forgettable wisdom before tossing the white paper, like doomed sperm, out the window. </p>

<p>      We are looking for a motel, the one with the dumbest name is her rule. We settle on The Islander with a giant rainbow fish out front. Inside the room it is 1963. Ice buckets, VO5 hair gel and Vantage cigarettes.</p>

<p>      “I love it,” she says, hopping on the too-solid mattress. </p>

<p>      I turn the Magnavox to the weather. America is shown tie-dyed in reds, blues, greens and yellows. Systems move across her face. A man in a tight suit tries to explain. </p>

<p>      “I want to call my first book The Nocturnal Scream of the Ape,” she says. “New York will understand.” </p>

<p>      At the birthplace of John Wayne, my camera dies. She laughs beside the bust of The Duke, stoned. “Maybe this is just something to take home in your mind.” </p>

<p>      We move in together, eating dinner in near total darkness. She says she hates the sight of food. </p>

<p>Journal entry: Some relationships are like watching a flower flourish and die in elapsed time. </p>

<p>      We are bitter about our living conditions. Poor, the both of us. “I just want an uncrooked floor in a neighborhood where I won’t get shot at with a decent stove and not owned by Satan. Is that too much to ask?” </p>

<p>      I have always but a few dollars in my checking account which I monitor obsessively like the vital signs of a dying patient. </p>

<p>      She has ideas for money: Think Twice Abortion Cards, wants to market this to Hallmark.</p>

<p>      A video concept: Psych Majors Gone Wild. </p>

<p>      She wants a new holiday: Punch an Asshole in the Mouth Day.</p>

<p>      Have Anonymous Sex With A Stranger Day. </p>

<p>      I am almost inclined. </p>

<p>      She is talking for weeks now about her need to hemorrhage.</p>

<p>      “I want ulcers,” she says. “I want to bleed...” </p>

<p>      “You do bleed.”</p>

<p>      “I want to bleed more...”</p>

<p>      I catch her cutting her palms with a razor one night, listening to talk radio. </p>

<p>      She is drawing again, sending me on errands to buy pads of expensive Paris Bleedproof, furrowing the surface with crow quills and singeing designs with a Bic. </p>

<p>      From a crack-addicted neighbor, she buys a dog we cannot afford for nine dollars. </p>

<p>Journal entry: Life is not unlike crouching in a ditch while mortar shells explode around you. </p>

<p>      Dog dies of disease unknown. She attempts to bury it and cannot get the shovel into the earth. She places the dog in a garbage bag and throws it into the river. Instead of sinking, it floats towards the water filtration plant.</p>

<p>      “I can’t even bury a dog right,” she says, tears streaking down her face. </p>

<p>      She’s trying to sell things to pawn shops. Unreasonable things: rusty guitar strings, a broken humidifier, a protractor from high school, rationalizing she has no use for them. Not considering why others would. </p>

<p>      “I’ll bring down this pig system if it kills me!” she says more and more. </p>

<p>      The night before her species change, she collapses, overmedicated in an alley.</p>

<p>      The cops are not kind.</p>

<p>      “What’s the story, Hemingway? This chic your girlfriend?” </p>

<p>      A light snow is starting to fall.</p>

<p>      With any luck, it will cover everything.</p>
