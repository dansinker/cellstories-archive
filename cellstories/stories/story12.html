		</p><p>“Hi this is operator 14458 F with the TTY Online Relay Service, I’ve got someone on the line who would like to speak with you, have you done a relay call before? No? Well, allow me to explain. The person calling you requires an operator’s assistance to communicate over the phone, so for this call, I’m going to be typing everything you say and then voicing everything the caller types to me. When you hear me say, “Go ahead,” that means it’s your turn to speak. Then, when you’re done speaking you say, “Go ahead,” as well. Do you understand?” </p>

<p>“No, I’m not trying to sell you anything, I’m just an operator. This is a normal call--No--The person calling you just needs help--Ma’am, I’m an operator, speaking for someone who needs help communicating over the phone. I’m just, like an interpreter, so I would ask you to treat this like any other call. Okay? Great, we’ll start then. The caller has typed “Hi, I’d like to order a pizza for delivery,” go ahead.” </p>

<p>“That means it’s your turn to speak. Remember when you hear me say, “go ahead,” that means the caller is done talking and it’s your turn to speak. Okay? Great. Let’s try this again. “Hi, I’d like to order a pizza for delivery.” Go ahead.” </p>

<p>“Okay, ma’am, one more time that means it’s your turn to speak. When you her me say—Ma’am… Ma-am?… “ </p>

<p>Shit. The woman had hung up. I typed this information back to the poor caller, who was just trying to order a pizza, and he thanked me for my services and disconnected. This was a pretty common occurrence two years ago when I worked as a relay operator for a few months when I was living in Montreal. The company that hired me ran this free service, accessed through the Internet, to facilitate phone calls for the hearing impaired. In a given eight-hour shift, I would be in the middle of twenty-five to forty phone calls.  </p>

<p>The call center I worked in was made up of rows and rows of open, gray cubicles. No walls and the constant noise of frenzied tapping keys, driven by the rhythmic strum of two hundred voices talking in the same low, formal tone. On this particular night, I was in the middle of one of these rows, and could hear the conversations of the two operators beside me, but didn’t know either of them. I glanced at the operator to my left: she was a grumpy-looking middle-aged woman who hadn’t acknowledged me once. To my right was an average looking post-grad type: blond, glasses, converse. Nice enough. After the commotion of that last call, he’d leaned back in his chair and gave me a sympathetic look. I shrugged in return, when another call appeared on my screen, so I dialed the number and waited for someone to pick up.   </p>

<p>“Hello?” </p>

<p>“Hi this is operator 14458 F with the TTY Online Relay Service, I’ve got someone on the line who would like to speak with you, have you done a relay call before?” </p>

<p>“Hi, operator, yes. Yes, I have.”  </p>

<p>“Oh—great,” I said, relieved, “Okay, well, the caller has typed “Hi, Kara. It’s me. Go ahead.’“  </p>

<p>She responded—Kara responded with a casual, “Hey, Danny. Hold on one second while I change phones? Go ahead.” Her voice was direct, yet soft and welcoming. I typed her words back to the caller—Danny—who’s response appeared on my computer screen, and I voiced it to Kara.  </p>

<p>“Sure, no problem, I’ll wait, go ahead.” There was a long pause, a couple of clicks, and she returned to the line.  </p>

<p>“Okay, that’s better. Go ahead,” I heard Kara say, so I typed that in it to Danny and leaned back in my grey, ergonomic, computer chair.  </p>

<p>This was going to be a breeze. The callers clearly knew each other and were familiar with the relay service, so all I had to do was settle comfortably in the middle of their conversation and facilitate. To do that properly, I was to speak in a neutral distant tone. The company stressed this incessantly – to speak as the invisible, yet professional, third member of a two-person call. I had a sweet go-to operator voice that I always spoke in. </p>

<p>“Well I’m glad you are so comfortable. Go ahead,” I said in monotone as the lines appeared on my screen.  </p>

<p>“Oh! Shut up! Go ahead.”  </p>

<p>Surprised, I typed those words back to him. Danny typed the word laughing in parenthesis, on my screen.  </p>

<p>“Laughing” I relayed to Kara. Then, “Hey baby, did you get that thing I sent you in the mail? Go ahead.”  </p>

<p>“No! Not yet! It’s driving me crazy, why don’t you just tell me what it is? Go ahead.”  </p>

<p>As I’m sure you can tell, this call was pretty casual. Most of the other calls I’d get were business-type calls with bankers, clients, AT&T, or stupid fucking automated voice systems. The personal types of calls were typically among family, talking casual. I could easily zone-out or sneak a couple pages of the book I’d brought to work, but I didn’t for this one. I was interested in this one. Admittedly, I started to get into it.  </p>

<p>“Oh, how’s your dog doin’?” Kara asked, “How’s little…Ruffles? I can’t believe you named him after a bag of potato chips. Go ahead.” I typed that cheeky jab back to Danny—kind of excited for what he wanted me to say in return. </p>

<p>You see, by hour-one, I started to piece together information about Danny and Kara: they were both in their twenties with playful senses of humor, and had been dating long-distance. Six months? Maybe a year? He was in Kansas City, her somewhere in Colorado. I imagined each of them perched comfortably in their homes: Danny, probably lounging on his grey, worn-in dude-couch, a laptop resting on his stomach; Kara was harder. I saw her gazing out her bedroom window, warm posters coloring the walls, maybe lying on top of her comforter and idly fiddling with it. </p>

<p>“Hey! I named him Ruffles cause he’s got ruffles. He’s ruffle-y. Go ahead,” I said to Kara, via Danny, whose responses were starting to crack me up. 
<br>“Oh, Whatever,” she countered, “I’ve seen your stash of Sour Cream & Onion. Go ahead.” (I typed this to Danny.) </p>

<p>“Baby. Why would I name my dog after Ruffles. Why? I’m a Dorito man! Go ahead.” 
<br>“Oh, you’re not fooling anyone, baby. Go ahead.” And I typed in her response.  </p>

<p>They were talking about nothing. Absolutely nothing. But that’s what you do in a long-distance relationship! I knew this oh-so-well, because I’ll confess: at the time, I was in a long-distance relationship. With Katie back in Chicago. We had met over the holidays three months back and within a week we were so in love. We were. But within two weeks, I was on a flight back to Montreal. Katie and I would talk on the phone, long-distance, almost every night. We created this intimate world together talking about how our days went or a new myspace comment or Dolly Parton’s spouse-like relationship with her lady tour-manager (look it up). Just like Danny and Kara were doing, talking about Ruffles! Soon enough, my operator voice was anything but neutral.  </p>

<p>“So, baby, did you get my special email today? Go ahead,” I asked in a low, comfortable voice, via Danny. </p>

<p>Kara responded with an embarrassed “Oh, god!” If she could have playfully slapped me over the phone, she would have. “Yes! Yes, I got your pictures…Go ahead.” 
<br>“Good…” I paused for effect. “And? Go ahead.” </p>

<p>“Well, you should not be sending me that stuff through email! What if someone at work saw? I would die! Go ahead.”  </p>

<p>A surge of laughter spit through my mouth, and I could barely keep it silent, because Katie and I totally sent dirty pictures to each other. All the time. Don’t even try to tell me you haven’t done this, too. A sexy cell-phone snapshot here, a naked digital JPEG there. Phone-sex? Don’t worry, I didn’t have to facilitate phone-sex between Kara and Danny—that’s not where this story’s going—but knowing that other people did this kind of stuff was strangely comforting. And hilarious. </p>

<p>“Okay, okay I promise I’ll picture-message you next time. But…” I paused for effect, “did you like it? Go ahead.”  </p>

<p>Kara sighed, “Yes, baby, of course I did. Go ahead.” </p>

<p>“And…?” my voice was oozing velvet at this point “That’s all you’re going to say? Go ahead.”  
<br>She paused before letting out, “And… I wanted to fuck your brains out, alright?! I miss you so much! Go ahead.” </p>

<p>“Haha! Wooo! Yeah, me, too, baby. I know it’s hard. Go ahead,” I said, lost in my unexpected victory.  
<br>By hour-two, I had slipped fully into a character voice of Danny—or Katie, maybe—or even myself—I don’t know what was going on, but I was in their world, and I loved it. I could feel them connecting further to each other. Plus, I was charming Kara’s socks off! By hour-three, we were all reluctant to hang up, and playing the ‘you hang up, no you hang up’ game. I was hamming it up. </p>

<p>“Ladies first, baby. I was just trying to be a gentleman, and wait for you to hang up. Go ahead,“ I crooned, like a late-night radio. </p>

<p>Then, the very last lines of the scene appeared in front of me. And I gasped, my hands touching the lower halves of my cheeks in shock.  </p>

<p>“Just one thing more … I love you. Go ahead.”  </p>

<p>It was the first time. I knew it. After getting to know these people for three hours, I intuitively knew it. I could hear Kara in shocked silence. After a beat, she broke character and addressed me directly, “Operator, could you repeat that last line, please?” </p>

<p>This rarely happened, but when it did, we were supposed to keep the caller informed of any side talk, so I typed in parenthesis, “repeating line” back to Danny. I took a breath, a little teary-eyed now, and whispered again, “Just one thing more. I love you. Go ahead.”  </p>

<p>She took it in one more time. I could hear her breathing, shallow and shake-y. I typed, “silence” in parenthesis back to Danny. Kara asked me to repeat it one more time after that. And I did. Barely holding it together. I pictured Danny’s face inches away from the screen, waiting closely; Kara, on the edge of her bed now and frozen in place.  </p>

<p>Then, she responded with a, “(sniff) finally, baby,” and a,  “good night” and she gently hung up the phone. I guess she had said it first. I typed in her message and informed Danny that she had hung up. He thanked me for my services and said goodbye. Click. Silence. </p>

<p>I was so taken aback that I had to log off the computer and compose myself for a second! I pushed my grey, ergonomic computer chair back a bit, and reveled in the scene I was just privy to. Hell, the scene I was just a part of. Wow. A smile tugged at the edges of my lips in wonderful thought and emotion. When Katie had first said that it slipped out accidentally after a long night of drinking.  </p>

<p>I glanced to my right and—immediately caught the eyes of the operator next to me. He was staring. I quickly checked myself and then looked to the left of me, more composed this time. The middle-aged woman from before was also staring with this look.  </p>

<p>Shit. </p>

<p>I logged back on as fast as I could and another call came right up, so I shrugged off their looks casually. I glanced at my watch, affecting a bored sigh, “God, will this shift ever end,” nervously laughed at the both of them, and powered through the last leg of my shift. Neither of them said anything. </p>

<p>From that point on, I kept my operator voice professional on all calls: neutral and distant, always. But that night, when I got home, I called Katie. I pictured her lounging on her vintage old-man couch, full wine glass in hand, probably watching some stupid 80’s movie. And there I was: sitting on my futon, back propped against my rich, green bedroom wall, gazing out my window, and idly picking at my comforter.  </p>

<p>“Hey baby, it’s me. You’re never gonna believe what happened to me today.”</p>

<p>Go ahead.</p>
