		</p><p>Their house was once part of a battery chicken farm. A stained glass rooster (mangy) embellishes the front door.  It’s a crappy house with something of a death row feel about it.  Out the back where the poultry sheds used to be, the yard is made up entirely of dried-out chicken shit. Layer upon compacted layer of the stuff. The kids think it’s great they dig it up by the ton and turn it into building materials. So far they’ve built a chicken shit Guggenheim museum, a couple of chicken manure four-wheel drives and a dog kennel. Mostly their dog, an Irish wolfhound named Nessie, gives her kennel a wide berth.  Nessie’s turds, also, are piled up around the back yard. They’re as big as anvils.  The children are named Dougal, Duncan and Hamish in honour of their dead Scottish grandfather. Although barely average height their Grandad had always seemed to their mum, Rowena, to stand head and shoulders above other men. Legend has it he was as handsome as a God - full of contempt for anything you cared to mention. He’d bullied their grandmother, shoving her around as if she was a sack of potatoes. Their mother, they know, thinks about their grandfather every single day, she thinks about him in the mornings when the sun’s streaming through the cockerel on the front door, and at lunchtime when she’s making them vegemite sandwiches. Rowena thinks about him last thing at night before she climbs into bed and has sex with their dad, Jim. Sometimes she has half-hearted sex with  Jim; mostly she just has tired sex. The kind of sex where she lies back with her eyes closed and her legs spread trying not to remember what a dud of a day she just had. Trying not to notice the way her body spreads almost all the way across the futon mattress these days. Wondering how and when it was she got to be so big; stretched like a rubber band. Like something a whole lot bigger and fleshier than a rubber band. She thinks about their grandad again when she gets up in the middle of the night for a pee. When they were younger Duncan and Hamish and Dougal would take it in turns to wipe their Mum’s arse. They’d line up outside the loo door pushing and shoving each other, “No it’s my turn you did it last time.” Sometimes their fingers poked right through the paper, when this happened their Mum let out a yell, and jumped off the toilet seat. Their mother allowed her children to take all manner of liberties with her body. They soaped her as she lay soaking in the bathtub. They combed her hair, and squeezed toothpaste onto her toothbrush. When they drew pictures of their mum at school they always drew in the black and bushy shrubbery growing between her legs. They drew every one of her toenails as well. They drew all of her eyelashes, at least fourteen for each of her eyes. Their mum was big and round and full of weird ideas, and grievances. They loved her dearly even when she shouted at them to pick their books and toys up off the floor.  </p>

<p>9pm and the sun’s setting behind the four-wheel drives (organic) parked in the backyard. Dougal, Duncan and Hamish are climbing into their beds.  <i>Beds are where the bed bugs are. The pitter-patter over the sheets of tiny buggy feet. Buggy eyes bulging in the dark.</i>  Rowie is telling them all, “Good night” and turning out the lights. They wish they could clamber into her arms for a bear hug but their mother’s looking exhausted. Anyway they understand everything in the known universe is destined to eventually come to an end - every bus ride to school, every opportunity for a cuddle. For their dinner tonight they’d had poached eggs on toast. As they ate their meal Rowie talked about the way certain dinosaurs had hatched from eggs millions of year ago that were so massive they’d roamed the earth flattening the forests like giant bulldozers. Their mother is not only large (as a woolly mammoth) but wonderfully well informed. <i>Their father Jim (smaller by far than Rowena) riding their mother at night like a jockey, hanging on for dear life.</i></p>

<p>      After dark a hooting of owls and the wind marking time outside the children’s bedroom windows - the hum of the telly coming from the living room where their parents are doing something they call <i>relaxing</i>. They’re sitting on the sofa with their legs stretched out in front of them while the television babbles incoherently. Hairs are dropping out of their father’s head one at a time and falling onto the carpet (the onset of male pattern baldness). Their mother’s swelling belly is a wave gathering momentum on its way to some distant shoreline. Rowena, they know, is pregnant again. It’s possible in her womb an unborn baby brother or sister is stirring.  Half-formed with buds unfurling into legs and arms. And if not a sibling, then perhaps their grandfather lying in his coffin dressed in his kilt and sporran. When he was alive, they’ve been told, their mother had been the apple of their grandfather’s eye - at least when she was a teenager. She’d been so sweet, so virginal he claimed, just looking at her made men’s hearts leap. He’d spied on her whenever she left the house, cruised the streets in his car trying to catch her making out with boyfriends. Rowena was his bonnie wee lass, too good for mortal man.  </p>

<p>Rowena making the floorboards creak on her way to bed just after midnight.  Some days her head <i>felt so heavy</i>. Heavy like a brick, like a block of cement. She half-expected it to topple off her shoulders and crash onto the floor, shattering into pieces. One piece for each of her children. One for Jim. Another for her mother who visits at Christmas and whose only oratory is one of complaint. <i>Her knees are wearing out. She needs new glasses.</i> One as well for the far off days of her childhood when her father sat her on his knee tickling her hair with his breath. Lastly a pebble Rowie can carry around in her pocket, a stone of her own.  A rock to hurl like a lightning bolt.  </p>

<p>In the morning the children feed breakfast scraps to Ness under the kitchen table. Nessie is getting old and smelly. Her belly fizzes and gurgles like a blocked drain. Her farting is both constant and terrible. Hamish and Dougal and Duncan have plans to excavate a catacomb in the backyard some time soon. Eventually it will be a resting-place for not only Ness but for all her backyard turds as well. A couple of times every year they’ll haul Ness out of her grave to check her rate of decomposition. They expect her flesh to have rotted off her bones after a mere eighteen months or so. Duncan and Dougal particularly are very interested in forensic pathology. They’re interested in how long it takes a dysfunctional family to get its shit together - a mother to get over the death of a parent. Will it be months or years before their dad is completely bald? Will he still be lovable when his head looks like an eyeball?  </p>

<p>As a child Rowena had a friend who was haunted by a recurring nightmare. In her nightmare time marched blindly on forever and ever into eternity. The universe was awash with clocks, cuckoo clocks and grandfather clocks. Alarm clocks. Speaking clocks. Wrist watches. The sound of their ticking was thunderous. The girl covered her ears with her hands, “Stop!”
