<h2>The Motel</h2>

		</p><p>I lay in bed watching Kate, all curled up with herself, with my future growing inside of her. Before she'd drifted off to sleep she'd held me tight and mumbled, “I didn't know I wanted this, us, so much.” I watched her sleep. She was so.....still.  I tossed and turned, but finally, at four in the morning, I couldn't handle it anymore. Kate had her arms and legs intertwined all around me and it took every contortion I could muster in order to ease myself out of bed without waking her. I put on my clothes and three some things in a backpack. I looked back at Kate, her brown hair splayed across the pillows, so certain of her own happiness, not just one person anymore, but two....I shut the  bedroom door, grabbed the keys, slipped out the front and ran to the car. I didn't even think about leaving a note. I just took off.</p>

<p>I pulled onto the Dan Ryan, turned the music up loud, real loud, rolled the windows down and just drove, for hours...with no real destination in mind, the south seemed like a good bet so that's where I headed.  </p>

<p>Driving though Indiana, I imagined Kate and I married, there was no question about that even though we were only twenty-two, fresh out of college and had lived together for less than six months. Then there'd be a house in the 'burbs and a mortgage and more kids; passing through Kentucky I thought, well, just flat out tell her you don't want the kid. Which meant an abortion and I knew that would finish it all, the kid, Kate and me. In Tennessee, I figured, hell, why go back? Just keep driving, disappear, start a new life....any way I looked at it, it was still a life I hadn't really planned on.</p>

<p>But finally, somewhere outside of Charleston, South Carolina, eighteen hours later, exhausted, I checked into the Skylark Motel: the kind of place that attracts the overnight traveler, people forever on the road to somewhere else, just passing through... </p>

<p>I sat poolside, dangling my feet in the water, watching the sunlight fade behind the motel. It was quiet and the great dark sky was just opening up... </p>

<p>“You want a cold beer? We got plenty.” There was the snap and sizzle of a can being opened. I turned around and directly behind me at a wrought iron table shrouded by a huge umbrella, sat an older couple, in their late forties, I supposed. I was only twenty-two and when your that age everyone over thirty looks <i>old</i>, I mean <i>really old</i>, right? They looked fleshy, settled, sweating in the June heat, melting helplessly into their seats. A case of Miller High Life sat perched on the table between them.</p>

<p>“Sure,” I said, glad for some kind of reprieve from my thoughts. “A cold one sounds good.” </p>

<p>Frank and Grace Tuttle were from Kansas and they were sunburnt – they'd spent the day beach combing, bar-hopping. They were on “permanent vacation,” Frank said. Their only daughter had left and gone off to college. Frank was a salesmen and looked like one: a wide brimming I-aim-to-please kind of face with a bloodshot drinker's nose. A happy-go-lucky sort who never left the house without a box of samples. His wife, Grace, wore her black hair drawn in a tight bun. She looked worn out; a body gone soft with age and motherhood, but yet, underneath it all – in her dark eyes, mostly, the way they danced – there were remnants of someone who'd always stood out in a crowd. A high school prom queen perhaps. </p>

<p>Frank poked at his flaming sunburnt skin and grimaced. “I knew we should have used more of that sunblock!” </p>

<p>Grace just laughed. “Oh, don't be such a baby!” She looked at me and shook her head. “Isn't he just a big baby?” She popped another can of beer and lit a cigarette.  </p>

<p>It quickly became apparent to me that Frank and Grace Tuttle loved to argue. What contributions I made to their disagreements I no longer remember, but they didn't care what I had to say. Over several hours I drank beer after beer, getting quietly wasted, listening to them debate with vigor the First Gulf War, the benefits of sex education, vodka versus gin, broccoli or broccoli raab. </p>

<p>And then Grace starts talking about their kid, leaning over towards me, waving her beer around, “I wanted my daughter to study music in college. She's good, ya' know? She's good. But, well, Frank here says no. Not practical, he says. So she's at State studying accounting. Poor kid. Says she's perfectly happy.” </p>

<p>“And she <i>is</i>,” Frank says, the final word.</p>

<p>“-- Well, I don't believe her,” Grace sank low in her chair and narrowed her eyes like an angry cat. I could see it was the bickering over the kid that propelled their marriage, for better or for worse. And I? I was thinking about Kate...</p>

<p>See, one night I was in the kitchen, making pasta, Saturday night was pasta night. Kate and I shared a tiny one-bedroom apartment over in Wicker Park, and she came up to me with this mysterious smile on her face, like the Mona Lisa, and she had that little white wand in her hand, one of those pregnancy sticks, the dreaded EPT, and she showed me the tiny pink cross dancing positive and she was looking at me, shy and sweet..her brown eyes so totally without guile---open, joyous and she said to me, she said, “I'm pregnant.” And then she said, “I'm gonna have a baby, your baby...” And you know that sound when your playing a record and somebody knocks into the stereo and the needle goes buzzing and screeching across the vinyl? Well, the whole world, my world became that horrific sound at that moment and I was standing there, like an absolute fool with a pasta strainer in my hand, and I wanted to say, all of sudden, quickly and quietly to Kate, to life, to everything, “Whoa, whoa, whoa....let's just stop this right here, okay? Can we just back up a second? Can we? Please?”  </p>

<p>And Kate's smile got tighter, because she saw something in me was frozen, and then, despite the terror that filled my veins I reached out and grabbed her by the waist and pulled her right into me, whispering, “Katey Kate..I'm so happy.” And she buried her face in my shoulder, saying, “Are you sure? Really?” And I was thinking, a kid? Now? Adults had kids, right? Not me, not yet, maybe not ever. But I was too cowardly to say anything, for fear of hurting her. </p>

<p>I walked around in a daze for three weeks and acted like I was cool with everything, and even in that short amount of time Kate changed. She had this motherly shine, that yellow glowing look everyone talks about, like the sun had been rubbed across every inch of her skin. So. There was that. And there was the puking, the morning sickness, me holding her hair back as she spilled her guts...and then, eventually, me bailing out. </p>

<p>“You sure are a quiet one,” And I snapped out my thoughts. Grace was staring at me with big brown curious eyes.</p>

<p>“Where's Frank?” I asked.  </p>

<p>“Taking a piss,” she said. “And getting more beer. Thirsty?” She offered me a swig out of her can. I declined, but her gaze lingered on my face, like she was searching me, trying to know me. Then I felt something moving up my leg and looked down to see Grace's hot little bare foot squirming its way up my thigh to rest like a little puppy....in my lap.</p>

<p>“Uhm, Grace?” I said. I shifted in my chair but her foot remained firmly in place.</p>

<p>She cocked her head to the side and smiled one of those flirty puffy pouty smiles, not a  matronly smile at all. “Yes?” </p>

<p>“What're you doing, Mrs. Tuttle?” </p>

<p>“Oh, don't play so innocent with me...” Her voice was coy, but it sounded forced, like she was willing herself into the next moment. Her little foot squirmed around some more and I have to admit I felt a hot shiver race up my spine and the world rolled on its axis. Kate was far away. And here was a ripe MILF hitting on me. Me! When you're twenty-two years old you're <i>supposed</i> to be on the loose, having adventures, being corrupted by older married women...right? Her foot in my lap was like an invitation to all the possibilities of life. But still I felt kind of sorry for the both of us. Before I could say anything I heard Frank shuffling along the pavement. </p>

<p>"To be continued?" Grace said. </p>

<p>And without missing a beat she withdrew her foot and readjusted her face as if nothing had happened. Frank, completely unaware, nestled back into his chair, popped a can of beer, sipped at its froth. “Smells like rain,” he said, apropos of nothing. And then they went back to arguing. Again.  </p>

<p>I took that opportunity to excuse myself.  </p>

<p>Back in my stuffy little motel room, I looked out through the curtains and saw them going at it under the dim light of the moon. Peppering each other with insults; fortifying themselves with anger. And I thought, so this is where it all leads, huh? Marriage and kids and time.. </p>

<p>It was late, past three in the morning. I lay in bed, drunk, suffocated by the absolute stillness in that room and every time I closed my eyes I would see Kate sitting on the front porch steps of our apartment looking off down Potomac Street waiting for me...  </p>

<p>Then there was a quiet knock at the door. I stumbled sleepily across the room and opened it.</p>

<p>And there Grace was, standing shyly, one foot on the other. Without a word she stepped  across the threshold of the door trailing a sweet earthy perfume and turned to face me. Her black hair had a waxy sheen to it, like glass and she stood there with her shoulders thrown back offering herself up, but the corners of her mouth were trembling. </p>

<p>“Frank's asleep,” she whispered, as if that explained everything. </p>

<p>“Ummm...okay,” I said. The blue-white shadows of the TV and the dim yellow bulb from the bathroom created a strange light in the room. Almost like the rest of the world didn't exist. </p>

<p>My eyes roamed the carpet at her feet.  </p>

<p>“I guess I just don't feel like myself tonight,” she said, her voice faltering. “I'm sorry.”</p>

<p>I started to say something, but she shook her head. Our eyes fastened on each other. And I saw it on her face... she's scared. It was a relief to find a kindred spirit. And I understood..we're both running away. </p>

<p>I lurched toward her and she clutched at me and we were kissing beer-stained kisses and fell onto the bed and she slipped free of her sundress and pulled off my shirt and shorts. Her skin was soft and giving and must surely have snapped with vitality when she was that young beauty queen, and her nails bit into my shoulder and we were a tangle of clothes and arms and legs, but then, like a strobe light flashing in the dark, I saw Kate..her expectant eyes and glowing skin and that innocent look on her face when she told me she was pregnant... .I couldn't out run it.</p>

<p>And just as quickly as it started, whatever it was between Grace and I.. it just died. I rolled off of her. She went still. We just lay there. She pulled a bedsheet across her body, up to her chin.  And we were quiet for awhile, the TV silently flickering in the dark room. Then Grace rubbed at her face. “My husband...I don't love him anymore.” She said it as if she were testing how it sounded out loud, in the open air. </p>

<p>“My girlfriend's pregnant.” Grace was the first person I'd told. </p>

<p>She took my head between her hands and said, “You're not ready. You're just not.” She made it sound like it was much more that I wasn't ready for, not just a kid, but life. </p>

<p>At some point I dozed off. I'm not sure how long, maybe an hour. Grace nudged me awake and she was standing by the bed, already dressed. The sun was creeping through the edges of the drawn curtains. </p>

<p>“I need to get back,” she said. </p>

<p>I packed up my things as fast as I could. I gave Grace a hug and a kiss before I opened the door and that was strange because I had no idea who this person really was, yet I felt closer to her than anyone in the world at that moment. </p>

<p>I scurried to my car. I watched Grace walk back to her room from maybe fifty feet away, my car partly obscured by a large hanging willow tree. She stood in front of the door, her head down. She wasn't going to run away. Going back to the life she had made, for what it was worth. She knocked at the door. Frank opened it immediately. Behind him, the room was bright yellow. Every light was vivid and aware. They stared at each other for a moment. Then she began to talk. I could see her head nod; her shoulders collapsed ever so much. I've spent a long time wondering what she said to him. I saw him look past her and search the parking lot. Then he stepped aside. Grace put her head down and disappeared into the room. I waited for a minute, then backed slowly out of the parking lot. I pulled onto the interstate, rolled the windows down, and turned the music up loud, real loud. And headed home.</p>
