<h2>Mother Nature</h2>
	<h3>Jessica Young</h3>

		</p><p>As long as I could menstruate, I’ve known I do not want to have kids. I love kids; I just don’t want any. I want to invest my time and money on theatre tickets and yoga retreats and travel, not diapers and braces and tuition. It’s not always the most popular choice. My close friends say, “Jess, you’d make such a great mother.” Some of the spiritually conservative ones tell me that motherhood is my womanly duty; God put me on the planet to procreate, and not doing so is not fulfilling His will for me. (gag) My mother likes to go on about how parenthood will change me. “You’ll understand why I worry about you so much when you have kids. It’ll make sense then.” </p>

<p>      Finally, I got sick of hearing this as her excuse for bossing me around and I told her, “Mom I don’t want kids. I’m not having any.” </p>

<p>      I braced myself for a lecture, but to my surprise, she smiled at me and said, “I used to sound just like you when I was your age. Believe me, you’ll change.” </p>

<p>      But kids aren’t for me. I think that maternal-instinct-biological-clock thing is total crap. I’m too hip to be a mom; I’m going to run around the world, making things and collecting really cool experiences because I don’t have to blow my savings on children. I’ll be “Auntie Jess” to all my friends’ kids, my life exciting, surprising, and happily child-free. </p>

<p>      People say when you meet the One, you’ll want to have kids with them: like the right man flicks the mommy switch inside you. I’m open to that: my fiancé is an incredible guy. He’s thoughtful and funny and really talented, and he’d make a great father; but frankly, I don’t want to share him with any snotty-nosed four-year-old who wants to hear a story. When we started having sex, I didn’t want to keep worrying about birth control, so I went to Planned Parenthood. 
<br> 
<br>     I spent 40 minutes in a waiting room, smiling weakly at the teenage girls in their tight jeans and cheap jewelry, and reading various STD pamphlets, until a woman in sky blue scrubs called my name. She ushered me into a gray room plastered with contraceptive posters and various diagrams of my indoor plumbing. I changed into the drafty paper gown, and when the doctor came in, I opened wide. She put one gloved hand on my lower belly, lubed up two fingers of the other, and proceeded to go at me like a matron stuffing a chicken. I winced as she groped at my organs, routinely at first, and then a little slower. She paused. </p>

<p>      “Huh.” </p>

<p>      I stared at the ceiling tiles, counting the dimples and trying not to feel vulnerable. “Is something wrong?” I asked. </p>

<p>      “Well, it’s just, your uterus is really… big.” </p>

<p>      I sat up and leaned on my elbows. </p>

<p>      Big is a fine word. I can think of all kinds of variations of that sentence I’d be happy to hear. Your book advance is really big. Your IQ is really big. Your heart is really big. Even, your butt is really big. But not this. </p>

<p>      “What?” I asked. </p>

<p>      She had stick straight, long, brown hair, and these giant glasses on, straight out of 1987, that reflected the fluorescent light overhead. She snapped off the latex gloves and picked up my chart and started writing in it. “Yeah, don’t let it freak you out, but I think I’m gonna order a pregnancy test.” </p>

<p>      Are you fucking kidding me? Who taught this woman how to talk to patients? </p>

<p>      So she gave me the plastic cup, and I got dressed and went to pee in it, and then sat on a blue plastic chair outside her office in a dazed, speechless ball while three minutes ticked away and she waited for the strip to turn pink or blue or whatever color it was supposed to turn.  </p>

<p>      So you know about this wait, right? Whether you hope the test is positive or negative, waiting for it is agonizing. I sat there with nothing to do but wait, squirming in the chair, biting my lip and bouncing one leg in worry. The voice inside my head screamed, this is impossible. I’ve always used two methods of birth control, because I didn’t want any accidents. Why did I go off the pill in the first place? CP and I have been extra careful with our mechanics; I mean, it’s not rocket science. My period’s not late; I’m not pregnant, right? I am broke; I can’t afford to have a kid right now. And holy shit, I don’t have any health insurance; how do you have a kid without health insurance? So that means… an abortion. And I’m staunchly pro-choice, even in the face of my socially conservative family. But damn, now here I am with this big uterus, and it’s one thing to vote in favor of abortion but another thing to have to actually decide if you’re going to abort the life growing inside you, and sure, you swear up one side and down the other that you don’t want kids, but now you may have one, and you’re not a teenager, so you don’t really have an excuse to put it up for adoption, you have to keep it and raise it, and what happens to your life if you do that, and what about my fiancé? Omigod this is gonna freak him out and he’ll bolt and I’ll have to raise our child all alone. </p>

<p>      “So it’s negative,” the doctor said, crouching beside me. “But I can’t prescribe you any birth control until we find out why your uterus is so big.” </p>

<p>      So I left the office with a pocketful of Durex and a referral for a gynecologist. After waiting three weeks, I got in to see a doctor at the Women’s Health Center for another exam. This place was no free clinic: the waiting room had warm lighting, wood paneling, and fliers about women’s health workshops. Dig this y’all: they even had a picture book explaining the clitoris; and hey, I thought I knew about mine, but this book was really informative. </p>

<p>      The doctor had a wise, gap-toothed smile, salt-and-pepper hair, and a gravely voice that bespoke a recently-ended cigarette habit. She read my referral and asked about my family history, and then gave me another exam. As soon as the she touched me, she knew. “Oh, yeah,” she said, “you’ve got fibroids.” </p>

<p>      Fibroid tumors: hunks of muscle fiber that grow and knot and fold on themselves until they stretch out the uterus. At their smallest, the size of a pea, at largest, they fill up the abdominal cavity. My mother had fibroids. She said the words and like that, I was thirteen again, standing in a white-walled hospital hallway, looking down at her. She’d just had a hysterectomy at the age of 38—which is about twenty years too young. My mother had miscarried twice, and so now that they’d taken all her stuff, I knew, this was it. I was the only one; she couldn’t have any more children. They wheeled her past me into the recovery room, and she looked so small and distant. She was gray; I don’t mean ashy, she was gray, and I thought, I didn’t know black folks could get this gray, this is what my mother’s going to look like when she dies, and I cried because I was so sad and so scared. </p>

<p>      The truth is these things are common. It’s not cancer; 80% of women have developed some kind of fibroid by the time they’re 50. Black women are at least twice as likely as any other race to have them, and they’re hereditary. But I don’t care who you are, some days the numbers just aren’t comforting; some days your common, hereditary condition makes you feel as sad and lonely and confused as you were when you were thirteen. </p>

<p>      I sat up and looked at the doctor. “So what do I do?” </p>

<p>      “Do you want to have kids?” </p>

<p>      Not doing something because you don’t want to, is one thing. Not doing something because you can’t, is something else. I surprised myself by saying, “I don’t know. I don’t think so—not right now, but maybe… someday.” </p>

<p>      “Well, if I were your doctor, I’d tell you to start trying now, but since you sound like you don’t want to have kids, I won’t say that.” </p>

<p>      I told her surgery wasn’t possible; since I don’t have health insurance, I’d just have to learn to live with these things until further notice. I waited for her to say something about how even though I wasn’t sure now, if five years from now, or even ten, I was ready or willing, I’d still be able to. She didn’t. </p>

<p>      Before my appointment at the Women’s Health Center, I peeked at the form to see what was written in the notes. Enlarged uterus, it read. Sixteen weeks: they measure the size of a uterus the way they measure the growth of a baby. My uterus is as big as it might be if I were nearly four months pregnant. </p>

<p>      When a baby is sixteen weeks, she can suck, yawn and smile. She is five and a half inches long and weighs six ounces; her heart pumps 25 quarts of blood a day, and her little uterus contains the cells that will one day be her children. </p>

<p>      Tumors don’t do that. When a tumor is sixteen weeks—and if, like mine, it has a tumor entourage—it expands an organ in your body that’s ordinarily the size of a pear into the size of a cantaloupe. It presses into your spine so your back hurts all the time. It pushes against your intestines and your bladder, giving you the constipation of a junk-food-scarfing teenager and the eager need to pee of a geriatric. It gives you cramps, not the pleasant, little-baby-moving cramps, but cramps you feel every step you take, cramps that sometimes make it hard to stand up straight. This sixteen week tumor doesn’t want to share; if you actually do get pregnant, this sixteen week tumor is going to do everything it can do to terminate your pregnancy.  </p>

<p>      Do I want kids more now, now that I know that conceiving will be that much harder? Some days I remember chatting with my young cousins, and how much fun I have with the girls I baby-sit, and on those days I think twice. Then there are the days that I see a seven-year-old throwing a tantrum in the cereal aisle at Jewel, and I thank God that he is not my problem: the only boy I have to take care of is a grown one who plays nice with others, and the only toys I have to pick up are the ones he and I use in the bedroom. </p>

<p>      Some days I feel like I should want to have kids, like my body is conspiring with the Betty-Crocker-Clair-Huxtable instinct that everyone swears is part of a woman’s nature. Maybe I should start trying now, and hope that I’ll grow into a mother, because it might be too late if I wait until I really want this to happen. And this is the place where I’m supposed to say something wise and soothing, about how this whole thing has taught me patience, self-love and surrendering to my destiny, and we all leave here feeling better. But I can’t do that. I’m not patient: I’m mad. I’m mad that after all the things I’ve cut out of my diet—meat and fish, alcohol, sugar, caffeine, gluten, dairy—after all my hard work to stay healthy, I still can’t take a shit when I want to. I’m mad because I’ve seen several different doctors who all tell me different things, and for the last year I’ve had my body pumped full of synthetic hormones with horrible results. I’m mad because no matter how much I read, no matter how well-informed I am, I still have no idea what the hell is going on inside my body. There’s no spoonful of sugar to make this go down. There is only me, and my sixteen-week uterus, like a ticking time bomb inside me, and I can’t cut the wires to it.</p>
