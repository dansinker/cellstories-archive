<h2>Drugs</h2>
	<h3>Dmitry Samarov</h3>
	<p>
		</p><p>1.) Player of the Game</p>

<p>"Ashland and Cortez. Take me there fast. There's cocaine there."</p>

<p> These were his words before he even settled in the back seat. He got in out of the throng on Clark in the middle of Wrigleyville. His eyes were hidden behind cheap white plastic-rimmed sunglasses shielding him from the glare of night, his chin and cheeks decorated with a hipster's stubble, his red retro T-shirt with "Player Of The Game" spelled out in white with ornamental stars completing the design...</p>

<p> "Just being honest. Whatever you think at this time of night, man, just get me there fast," then, satisfied with the proposed route, he launched into a soliloquy about whether it was a good idea for his friend to cheat on his wife with someone from the office...</p>

<p> From time to time he'd inquire as to our progress, then sink back into his open-mouthed stupor. "Whoah, this is really far south. Where is Cortez anyway?"...Having only every fifth question answered or even acknowledged didn't faze him in the least. We pulled up to the address and he cast an uncertain look toward the condo, then paid up and stumbled across the street...</p>

<p>2.) Fruitless Loop</p>

<p>He stood in the middle of Division near Leavitt, forcing cars to veer around him. The bandaged hand was from a recent stint at the nearby Saint Mary of Nazareth, maybe the most hideous hospital in the city. He asked if he could smoke and if I had a light. I didn't, so we stopped at a liquor store to buy one, handing me his dead cellphone to see if it would fit my charger while I waited for him to return. After he got back in, the cigarette calmed him for spell, but soon he was rustling around in the shopping bags spread all over the back seat. </p>

<p>The destination he'd requested was changed as we approached what was left of Cabrini-Green. First we turned into one of the new subdivisons. Whatever he was looking for wasn't in any of the culs-de-sac therein, so we took Scott Street past one of the last bombed-out towers at a crawl while he scanned the desolation for some sign. We made several more fruitless loops before he said to stop. We were facing south on Clybourn across from the Dominick's. There was a pause, and I guessed he was getting ready to run, but he must've lost his nerve and began to count out his singles. Just as he was finally getting out of the cab, a rotund form in pink sweatpants came into view. She was only going a couple blocks, to those row houses off Chicago Avenue, the other sorry remnant of Cabrini. She thanked me profusely for stopping and said to lock the doors. Glad just to get a ride so unlike the ones only looking for something to take.</p>

<p>3.) Crack</p>

<p> Double-parked by the darkened courtyard in Garfield Park, I key in the Auto Callout code to summon my passenger. A group of young men loiter about the chain-link that surrounds the liquor store next door. They play-punch one another and otherwise horse about to break the monotony and keep the chill out of their bones. The minutes lurch forward with no sign of my guy and I put in the code for a 'No Show'...</p>

<p> Before I can pull away, a woman runs out from the furthest doorway and begs me to wait, "He's comin' it just take him a while", then disappears back into the murk. A man in a red and white track suit edges into view, moving along the wall of the building, stopping every few feet to gather himself before going on. Cracking the back door, he sucks the air in like a  landlocked carp. He wheezes for me to stay put. "Alright, I need you to take me to the hospital to get a new oxygen tank, then take me back, cool?...First, though, we got to find this guy, he's got somethin' of mine. Just go ahead, I'll tell you where."</p>

<p> We go west, slowing at alleys for no apparent reason, on a hunt with rules beyond my comprehension. Occasionally he barks out at passing men, their faces obscured by oversized hoodies, "Hey, where D? Know where he at?", with no satisfactory answers forthcoming...After about twenty minutes of this futility, I tell him that I've got places to be, that rolling around with him all night's not an option. He seems to understand and agrees to just go to the hospital and grab another cab back, "Let's just check this one place first..."
<br> 
<br> The 'one place' is another slum a couple miles south-west of where we'd been foraging. Pools of broken glass collect near the curbs and reflect the headlights' beams as we turn from one broken-down block to the next. Past unmarked squad cars out for bigger game, past pedestrians likely out looking for that elusive prize, past loiterers leaning on vehicles stilled for good...Protesting again about time lapsing, I manage to get us steered back homeward. Just then, he sees some invisible sign in the sidewalk that commands him urgently down the next unlit street, "This is it, I swear!"</p>

<p> We pull up to a two-flat and he rolls down the window, summoning someone from the rocking chair on the porch. After some whispered negotiations the new guy gets in and gives the street corner they want. Cop cars and paddy wagons whiz by at break-neck speeds, "Somebody got they asses shot for sure", is the verdict from the back seat. We turn off California a block from where all the sirens have come to rest. Here, a group based on a stoop of a boarded-up brownstone is doing a brisk business, passing baggies in exchange for bills to all comers. The loudly-marked taxi causes the young captains of industry a bit of pause, assuaged quickly by the crumpled fives passed through the rolled down window, and then we're off...</p>

<p> After splitting the spoils, we drop his partner off and head back to his place. The trip to that hospital's no longer necessary, in fact, he wants to double back for another hit of the medicine doled from the stoop. He doesn't protest much when I refuse...We end up back at that courtyard, same fellas still hanging around, apparently unable to meet my customer's discriminating needs. On his way out, in appreciation, he offers, "You're the type'a guy, people can't help but like ya!", and with that he creeps away, hugging the bricks back to entryway to his abode...</p>
