<h2>The Tattoo</h2>
	<h3>Nathan Hill </h3>

		</p><p>The young man wanted the tattoo because he thought of himself as very different. But different from what?</p>

<p>      He was different, he thought, from other people. From everybody else. From that great mass of <i>average people out there</i>. He honestly wasn’t sure. If he had to be specific, he’d say he was different from the people he might see in malls, though he rarely went to malls, or those people who eat at certain chain restaurants or who drive certain well-advertised sedans. He was different, let’s say, from anybody in television commercials, especially those commercials for body sprays or shaving creams or soup. He disliked television shows and blockbuster movies and bestsellers—the pleasures of the masses. In magazines he occasionally read, he noted the ads were not directed at him, nor were articles about investment banks and saving for college and managing your 401(k). He delighted in not knowing what a 401(k) was. He delighted in knowing there were millions of people out there who had 401(k)s and he was, he knew, different from them. He was different from anyone who played with their dog in the backyard on Sundays and paid their bills on time and put up decorations at Christmas. He was different from anyone who cut coupons and scouted stores for two-for-one deals; anyone who organized family Sundays, family dinners, family vacations; anyone who owned a crummy briefcase, a fake-gold watch, and woke up at the crack of dawn every day of the week.</p>

<p>      From these, yes, he was <i>quite</i> different.</p>

<p>      He knew very few people like this, but he was sure they were out there, that they existed, that they were in fact millions strong, and that he was very different from them.</p>

<p>      He did not have a philosophy other than this, being different. In fact, he avoided philosophies altogether. He believed having a philosophy made you the same as too many other people, and so he tried to be different even from people who themselves are quite different. He disagreed entirely with the nihilists, the anarchists, and punks. He was not a socialist nor a communist, not libertarian nor evangelical. Not a right-winger nor a left-winger. He was instead a swirl of contradictions and differences. He wanted to leave people with a sense of vertigo. He wanted them to believe he was one of the few genuinely original and authentic people in the whole world.</p>

<p>      His friends warned him. They said he would regret it someday. They said he should not get a tattoo so big and outrageous. He told his friends he would never become the kind of person who would regret this tattoo. “If I ever do regret it,” he told his friends, “it means I’m no longer myself.” He decided that only someone young and bold and different would find pleasure in such a tattoo. If he ever stopped enjoying his tattoo, it meant he was no longer young and bold and different and, therefore, no longer essentially him. It meant he had turned into someone that he, the young man, hated. Thus the tattoo was a very calculated insult thrown into the future. He was picking a fight with that other person, the awful older man the young man could someday become.</p>

<p>      So he got the tattoo. It was enormous. It was a bright and shocking tattoo, an aggressively <i>different</i> tattoo. The young man loved it.</p>

<p>      Then many years went by.</p>

<p>      The young man progressed academically. He traveled a lot. He was awarded advanced degrees in his field. He took a job, then a better one. He met a woman who, to his surprise, made him feel completely happy and content. He married her. He gained a little weight. Then a little more. He adopted various diets and joined gyms and managed his body, for the most part, effectively. His hair thinned just a bit, began turning gray at the temples. He was successful at work. He managed a team of several, and he generally enjoyed it. Then he had a daughter, and he delighted in watching her, first as a baby, trying to roll over, then later, as she began spitting out words, then taking tumbling classes, ballet classes. He couldn’t believe how many sappy things suddenly seemed perfectly charming. Like pushing the stroller around the mall racecar style, making engine noises, his daughter giggling. Or the two of them practicing pirouettes ridiculously in the living room. Or staying home Saturday nights to watch movies.</p>

<p>      And so it was that one morning the young man—now not so young—stepped out of the shower and looked in the mirror and saw the tattoo and felt, for the first time, a bolt of regret.</p>

<p>      He was running late that morning, and he needed to get his daughter to school on time, needed to make sure she was showered, fed, had her bookbag and so forth, and why would he think of the tattoo now? He rarely thought about it at all anymore. He was used to it. It had become part of him, part of his body, like a nose or a hand, something so usual that one rarely notes its existence. The tattoo was no longer very bright, and it was distorted in places where his flesh had swelled or slightly sagged. He remembered a time in his youth when getting the tattoo was the most important thing in the world. He was a different person back then. He was, he knew now, a fool. He hadn’t yet seen the world, lived life, fallen in love. His desire to be different was just a pose, an elaborate emotional defense mechanism, a way to seem unique and special to other people when he himself, emotionally, in his heart, did not feel unique and special. He had realized sometime in his late-twenties that he was acting out against his distant, unloving parents, rejecting all the symbols of their bourgeois suburban middle-class lifestyle. His wife and daughter helped him realize the joys of family dinners and family vacations. They went places together—the park, the mall—and he liked it. He realized the pleasures of the masses are such not because they are simple and stupid, but because they are often really pleasurable.</p>

<p>      So yes, when he was a young man he was naive and arrogant. So it goes. Most people, he noted, in their youth, are also naive and arrogant.</p>

<p>      But most people don’t have tattoos like this. And just then, as he thought that, staring in the mirror, wearing nothing but a soggy towel, a wave of hatred came over him.</p>

<p>      But hatred of what?</p>

<p>      Did he hate the young man he once was? That selfish and arrogant brat? Or did he hate the older man he had become? In a way, he realized, he hated both. He saw his older self through the eyes of his younger self, and he felt betrayed. He had a mortgage, a 401(k), a well-paying but ultimately unremarkable job, a marriage and child. His older self had abandoned all his younger self’s principles. He cut coupons. He woke up early. He owned a sedan. And he regretted this tattoo.</p>

<p>      How could two people so different ever inhabit the same body?</p>

<p>      The tattoo had not changed, but he had changed around it. He had become a different person. Or a different <i>version</i> of that person, one possibility among many. Maybe it’s like evolution, he thought, with all sorts of personalities inside him competing and clawing to get out. And his current self—which seemed to him pretty stable and suitable and more or less true—was no more true than his younger self. Someday a new person would emerge, a total stranger, and around him new friends would emerge and a new wife and a new daughter would emerge and they’d be an entirely new family. Maybe they’d become more wonderful, maybe repellent. Who knows? The people he loved, he thought now, were just visitors, and living inside them was the possibility of someone better or someone worse, someone good or boring or wretched. His wife, daughter, friends, coworkers—he could not count on any of them to be consistently <i>themselves</i>.</p>

<p>      And this saddened him.</p>

<p>      He got dressed. He covered up the tattoo. He walked into the kitchen, where he found his daughter. She was eating cereal and was still wearing her pajamas—the purple and white ones, with the unicorn on the front.</p>

<p>      “You’re not dressed,” he said, sort of sharply, the words coming out a bit more harsh and angry than he’d meant them.</p>

<p>      “Guilty!” she said dramatically, putting her hands above her head in the <i>don’t shoot</i> pose she’d seen on TV.</p>

<p>      “Cute.”</p>

<p>      “Fine,” she said. “I’ll change.” And she trudged off to her room.</p>

<p>      “Hurry,” he said, but he wanted to say something else. She wouldn’t have understood it, of course. But what he wanted to say was <i>don’t</i>.</p>
